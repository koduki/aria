Introduction Docker concepts Docker workshop Educational resources Home / Get started / What is Docker? What is Docker? Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. The Docker platform Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers: Develop your application and its supporting components using containers. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application. When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two. What can I use Docker for? Fast, consistent delivery of your applications Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Consider the following example scenario: Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run automated and manual tests. When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment. Responsive deployment and scaling Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments. Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. Running more workloads on the same hardware Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources. Docker architecture Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers. The Docker daemon The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services. The Docker client The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon. Docker Desktop Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see Docker Desktop. Docker registries A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes your image to your configured registry. Docker objects When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects. Images An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies. Containers A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine. A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear. Example docker run command The following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs /bin/bash. $ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration): If you don't have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create command manually. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machine's network connection. Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash. Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to your terminal. When you run exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container stops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it. The underlying technology Docker is written in the Go programming language and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

Docker is easy to use and popular for launching applications quickly without impacting your system. To use Docker, install it on your platform and build your first Docker image by writing a Dockerfile. Docker creates packaged applications called containers. Each container provides an isolated environment similar to a virtual machine (VM). Unlike VMs, Docker containers don't run a full operating system. They share your host's kernel and virtualize at a software level. Docker Basics Docker has become a standard tool for software developers and system administrators. It's a neat way to quickly launch applications without impacting the rest of your system. You can spin up a new service with a single docker run command. Containers encapsulate everything needed to run an application, from OS package dependencies to your own source code. You define a container's creation steps as instructions in a Dockerfile. Docker uses the Dockerfile to construct an image. Images define the software available in containers. This is loosely equivalent to starting a VM with an operating system ISO. If you create an image, any Docker user will be able to launch your app with docker run. How Does Docker Work? Containers utilize operating system kernel features to provide partially virtualized environments. It's possible to create containers from scratch with commands like chroot. This starts a process with a specified root directory instead of the system root. But using kernel features directly is fiddly, insecure, and error-prone. Docker is a complete solution for the production, distribution, and use of containers. Modern Docker releases are comprised of several independent components. First, there's the Docker CLI, which is what you interact with in your terminal. The CLI sends commands to a Docker daemon. This can run locally or on a remote host. The daemon is responsible for managing containers and the images they're created from. The final component is called the container runtime. The runtime invokes kernel features to actually launch containers. Docker is compatible with runtimes that adhere to the OCI specification. This open standard allows for interoperability between different containerization tools. You don't need to worry too much about Docker's inner workings when you're first getting started. Installing docker on your system will give you everything you need to build and run containers. Why Do So Many People Use Docker? Containers have become so popular because they solve many common challenges in software development. The ability to containerize once and run everywhere reduces the gap between your development environment and your production servers. Using containers gives you confidence that every environment is identical. If you have a new team member, they only need to docker run to set up their own development instance. When you launch your service, you can use your Docker image to deploy to production. The live environment will exactly match your local instance, avoiding \"it works on my machine\" scenarios. Docker is more convenient than a full-blown virtual machine. VMs are general-purpose tools designed to support every possible workload. By contrast, containers are lightweight, self-sufficient, and better suited to throwaway use cases. As Docker shares the host's kernel, containers have a negligible impact on system performance. Container launch time is almost instantaneous, as you're only starting processes, not an entire operating system. Getting Started Docker is available on all popular Linux distributions. It also runs on Windows and macOS. Follow the Docker setup instructions for your platform to get it up and running. You can check that your installation is working by starting a simple container: docker run hello-world This will start a new container with the basic \"hello-world\" image. The image emits some output explaining how to use Docker. The container then exits, dropping you back to your terminal. Creating Images Once you've run hello-world, you're ready to create your own Docker images. A Dockerfile describes how to run your service by installing required software and copying in files. Here's a simple example using the Apache web server: FROM httpd:latest RUN echo \"LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf COPY .htaccess /var/www/html/.htaccess COPY index.html /var/www/html/index.html COPY css/ /var/www/html/css The FROM line defines the base image. In this case, we're starting from the official Apache image. Docker applies the remaining instructions in your Dockerfile on top of the base image. The RUN stage runs a command within the container. This can be any command available in the container's environment. We're enabling the headers Apache module, which could be used by the .htaccess file to set up routing rules. The final lines copy the HTML and CSS files in your working directory into the container image. Your image now contains everything you need to run your website. Now, you can build the image: docker build -t my-website:v1 . Docker will use your Dockerfile to construct the image. You'll see output in your terminal as Docker runs each of your instructions. The -t in the command tags your image with a given name (my-website:v1). This makes it easier to refer to in the future. Tags have two components, separated by a colon. The first part sets the image name, while the second usually denotes its version. If you omit the colon, Docker will default to using latest as the tag version. The . at the end of the command tells Docker to use the Dockerfile in your local working directory. This also sets the build context, allowing you to use files and folders in your working directory with COPY instructions in your Dockerfile. Once you've created your image, you can start a container using docker run: docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-website:v1 We're using a few extra flags with docker run here. The -d flag makes the Docker CLI detach from the container, allowing it to run in the background. A port mapping is defined with -p, so port 8080 on your host maps to port 80 in the container. You should see your web page if you visit localhost:8080 in your browser. Docker images are formed from layers. Each instruction in your Dockerfile creates a new layer. You can use advanced building features to reference multiple base images, discarding intermediary layers from earlier images. Image Registries Once you have an image, you can push it to a registry. Registries provide centralized storage so that you can share containers with others. The default registry is Docker Hub. When you run a command that references an image, Docker first checks whether it's available locally. If it isn't, it will try to pull it from Docker Hub. You can manually pull images with the docker pull command: docker pull httpd:latest If you want to publish an image, create a Docker Hub account. Run docker login and enter your username and password. Next, tag your image using your Docker Hub username: docker tag my-image:latest docker-hub-username/my-image:latest Now, you can push your image: docker push docker-hub-username/my-image:latest Other users will be able to pull your image and start containers with it. You can run your own registry if you need private image storage. Several third-party services also offer Docker registries as alternatives to Docker Hub. Managing Your Containers The Docker CLI has several commands to let you manage your running containers. Here are some of the most useful ones to know: Listing Containers docker ps shows you all your running containers. Adding the -a flag will show stopped containers, too. Stopping and Starting Containers To stop a container, run docker stop my-container. Replace my-container with the container's name or ID. You can get this information from the ps command. A stopped container is restarted with docker start my-container. Containers usually run for as long as their main process stays alive. Restart policies control what happens when a container stops or your host restarts. Pass --restart always to docker run to make a container restart immediately after it stops. Getting a Shell You can run a command in a container using docker exec my-container my-command. This is useful when you want to manually invoke an executable that's separate to the container's main process. Add the -it flag if you need interactive access. This lets you drop into a shell by running docker exec -it my-container sh. Monitoring Logs Docker automatically collects output emitted to a container's standard input and output streams. The docker logs my-container command will show a container's logs inside your terminal. The --follow flag sets up a continuous stream so that you can view logs in real time. Cleaning Up Resources Old containers and images can quickly pile up on your system. Use docker rm my-container to delete a container by its ID or name. The command for images is docker rmi my-image:latest. Pass the image's ID or full tag name. If you specify a tag, the image won't be deleted until it has no more tags assigned. Otherwise, the given tag will be removed but the image's other tags will remain usable. Bulk clean-ups are possible using the docker prune command. This gives you an easy way to remove all stopped containers and redundant images. Graphical Management If the terminal's not your thing, you can use third-party tools to set up a graphical interface for Docker. Web dashboards let you quickly monitor and manage your installation. They also help you take remote control of your containers. Persistent Data Storage Docker containers are ephemeral by default. Changes made to a container's filesystem won't persist after the container stops. It's not safe to run any form of file storage system in a container started with a basic docker run command. There are a few different approaches to managing persistent data. The most common is to use a Docker Volume. Volumes are storage units that are mounted into container filesystems. Any data in a volume will remain intact after its linked container stops, letting you connect another container in the future. Maintaining Security Dockerized workloads can be more secure than their bare metal counterparts, as Docker provides some separation between the operating system and your services. Nonetheless, Docker is a potential security issue, as it normally runs as root and could be exploited to run malicious software. If you're only running Docker as a development tool, the default installation is generally safe to use. Production servers and machines with a network-exposed daemon socket should be hardened before you go live. Audit your Docker installation to identify potential security issues. There are automated tools available that can help you find weaknesses and suggest resolutions. You can also scan individual container images for issues that could be exploited from within. Working with Multiple Containers The docker command only works with one container at a time. You'll often want to use containers in aggregate. Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define your containers declaratively in a YAML file. You can start them all up with a single command. This is helpful when your project depends on other services, such as a web backend that relies on a database server. You can define both containers in your docker-compose.yml and benefit from streamlined management with automatic networking. Here's a simple docker-compose.yml file: version: \"3\" services: app: image: app-server:latest ports: - 8000:80 database: image: database-server:latest volumes: - database-data:/data volumes: database-data: This defines two containers (app and database). A volume is created for the database. This gets mounted to /data in the container. The app server's port 80 is exposed as 8000 on the host. Run docker-compose up -d to spin up both services, including the network and volume. The use of Docker Compose lets you write reusable container definitions that you can share with others. You could commit a docker-compose.yml into your version control instead of having developers memorize docker run commands. There are other approaches to running multiple containers, too. Docker App is an emerging solution that provides another level of abstraction. Elsewhere in the ecosystem, Podman is a Docker alternative that lets you create \"pods\" of containers within your terminal. Container Orchestration Docker isn't normally run as-is in production. It's now more common to use an orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm mode. These tools are designed to handle multiple container replicas, which improves scalability and reliability. Docker is only one component in the broader containerization movement. Orchestrators utilize the same container runtime technologies to provide an environment that's a better fit for production. Using multiple container instances allows for rolling updates as well as distribution across machines, making your deployment more resilient to change and outage. The regular docker CLI targets one host and works with individual containers. A Powerful Platform for Containers Docker gives you everything you need to work with containers. It has become a key tool for software development and system administration. The principal benefits are increased isolation and portability for individual services. Getting acquainted with Docker requires an understanding of the basic container and image concepts. You can apply these to create your specialized images and environments that containerize your workloads. Programming Linux Linux Follow Like Share Readers like you help support How-To Geek.

By Anthony Heddings Published May 4, 2020 Follow Like Link copied to clipboard Sign In To Your How-To Geek Account QUICK LINKS What Is Docker? Why Is Docker So Useful? How Do You Use Docker? Docker is a tool for running your applications inside containers. Containers package all the dependencies and code your app needs to run into a single file, which will run the same way on any machine. What Is Docker? Docker is similar in concept to Virtual Machines, except it's much more lightweight. Instead of running an entire separate operating system (which is a massive overhead), Docker runs containers, which use the same host operating system, and only virtualize at a software level. Docker Engine runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and supports Linux and Windows for Docker containers. The exact flavor of Linux doesn't actually matter; most versions of Linux will run the same kernel, and only differ in the user software. Docker can install this user software to the container, allowing you to run a CentOS container on Ubuntu. You couldn't though, for example, run FreeBSD on Ubuntu, since the kernels are different. The Docker container image includes only what your app needs to run. If your app makes use of nginx and Node.js, the container image will include them, but you won't be burdened with all the other userland apps you'd generally find on Linux. Why Is Docker So Useful? Docker takes the same kind of version control and packaging that tools like Git and NPM provide and allows you to use it for your server software. Since your container is a single image, it makes it very easy to version track different builds of your container. And since everything is contained, it makes managing all of your dependencies much easier. With Docker, your development environment will be exactly the same as your production environment, and exactly the same as everyone else's development environment, alleviating the problem of \"it's broken on my machine!\" If you wanted to add another server to your cluster, you wouldn't have to worry about reconfiguring that server and reinstalling all the dependencies you need. Once you build a container, you can share the container file with anyone, and they could easily have your app up and running with a few commands. Docker makes running multiple servers very easy, especially with orchestration engines like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Docker also allows you to organize your code for deploying on new services. Let's say you have a web server that you're using for your application. You likely have a lot of stuff installed on that server, you've got an nginx web server for hosting static content, you've probably got a database for storing some stuff on the backend, maybe you have an API server running on Express.js as well. Ideally you'd split these up into separate applications to run on separate servers, but development can get messy. Docker helps clean this up; you can package up your web server and run it with an nginx container, you can package up your API server and run it with a Node.js container, and you can package up your database and run it in it's own container (though that's maybe not the best idea, but it is possible). You can take these three Docker containers and run them all on the same machine. If you need to switch servers, it's as easy as migrating those containers to a new server. If you need to scale, you can move one of those containers to a new server, or deploy it across a cluster of servers. Docker can also save you money if you'd like to run multiple apps on a single VPS. If each app has different dependencies, it's very easy for your server to become cluttered, like a Thanksgiving dinner plate with everything mixing together. With Docker, you can run multiple separate containers with, for example, seperate versions of PHP, like a high school lunch tray with everything separated. How Do You Use Docker? In production, there are plenty of services to host Docker containers, including AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, DigitalOcean Docker Droplets, and many others. If your provider doesn't offer managed Docker hosting, you can always install it yourself on your VPS. In development, Docker containers are simple to run, and only require a few commands. To get started you'll need to install the Docker engine on your host OS. For Windows and macOS, you can use Docker Desktop, but for Linux you'll need to install Docker community edition from your package manager. For Debian based distros like Ubuntu, that would be: sudo apt-get install docker With either install method, you should have access to Docker from the command line now. To verify it's working, you can run: docker run hello-world Docker should pull this tutorial image from the Docker Hub, an online repository of many useful container images. You can use many of these images as a base to install your apps into. Let's create a simple web server based on nginx. Nginx provides a build on the Docker Hub that we can use as a starting point. Create a new directory to store the files, and open it: mkdir ~/dockertest && cd ~/dockertest Any changes done to the base nginx image will we done with a Dockerfile. Dockerfiles are like makefiles for containers, they define what commands to run when Docker builds the new image with your changes. The Dockerfile is simply called Dockerfile, with no extension. Create this file with touch Dockerfile, and open it up in a text editor. Paste this in: FROM nginx COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html The first line is a Docker command that tells Docker to base this image on the nginx image from the Hub. The second line is another command that copies over a directory from this local folder (~/dockertest/html) into the Docker image, in this case replacing the HTML folder for nginx. You can run plenty of commands in Dockerfiles. For example, if your app needs to install dependencies, you could do something like RUN cd src/ && npm install. Anything that your app needs to bootstrap it's installation and get up and running is defined in the Dockerfile. We haven't actually made the ./html directory yet, so go ahead and run: mkdir html && touch html/index.html To create the directory and the entry HTML. Open index.html and paste in some dummy HTML: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> Hello From nginx, inside Docker! Inside, your computer? </body> </html> Now we're ready to cook our image. Make sure you're at the root of the project (in ~/dockertest, not in the html folder) and run: docker build -t dockertest . The period at the end signifies that we'll be using the current directory as the starting point. Docker should find the Dockerfile, and get to work. It should only take a few seconds though, and when it's done, you can run it with: docker run --name DockerTest -p 8080:80 -d dockertest This will start up a new container called DockerTest, using the \"dockertest\" image we created. The -p flag binds a local port to a port inside the container, in this case binding nginx's default HTTP port (port 80) to port 8080 on your local machine. Open up localhost:8080 in your web browser, and you should see nginx running. If you wanted further configuration, you could edit nginx's config files by including COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and writing your own config file. This harder to configure than editing the config file directly, since you will have to rebuild the image on each edit. But for the added benefit of being able to take the same container you use in development and deploy it in production, it's a pretty fair tradeoff.

Last Updated : 07 Aug, 2024 Docker is a set of Platforms as a service (PaaS) products that use Operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than a virtual machine. Table of Content What is Docker? Why Docker is popular? What is a Dockerfile?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are light in weight which makes them portable and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system. Why Docker is popular? Docker gained its popularity due to its impact on the software development and deployment. The following are the some of the main reasons for docker becoming popular: Portability: Docker facilitates the developers in packaging their applications with all dependencies into a single lightweight containers. It facilities in ensuring the consistent performance across the different computing environments. Reproducibility: Through encapsulating the applications with their dependencies within a container it ensures in software setups remaining consistent across the development, testing and production environments. Efficiency: Docker through its container based architecture it optimizes the resource utilization. It allows the developers to run the multiple isolated applications on a single host system. Scalability: Docker’s scalability features facilitated the developers in making easier of their applications handling at time of workloads increment. Key Components of Docker The following are the some of the key components of Docker: Docker Engine: It is a core part of docker, that handles the creation and management of containers. Docker Image: It is a read-only template that is used for creating containers, containing the application code and dependencies. Docker Hub: It is a cloud based repository that is used for finding and sharing the container images. Dockerfile: It is a script that containing instructions to build a docker image. Docker Registry : It is a storage distribution system for docker images, where you can store the images in both public and private modes. What is a Dockerfile? The Dockerfile uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) and contains instructions for generating a Docker image. Dockerfile will define the processes to quickly produce an image. While creating your application, you should create a Dockerfile in order since the Docker daemon runs all of the instructions from top to bottom. (The Docker daemon, often referred to simply as “Docker,” is a background service that manages Docker containers on a system.) It is a text document that contains necessary commands which on execution help assemble a Docker Image. Docker image is created using a Dockerfile. To Know more about the Dockerfile refer to the Docker – Concept of Dockerfile . What is Docker Architecture and How Docker Works? Docker makes use of a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks with the docker daemon which helps in building, running, and distributing the docker containers. The Docker client runs with the daemon on the same system or we can connect the Docker client with the Docker daemon remotely. With the help of REST API over a UNIX socket or a network, the docker client and daemon interact with each other. To know more about working of docker refer to the Architecture of Docker . What is Docker Image? It is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container. They are a set of instructions used to create docker containers. Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how. Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application. The application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. What is Docker Container? Docker container is a runtime instance of an image. Allows developers to package applications with all parts needed such as libraries and other dependencies. Docker Containers are runtime instances of Docker images. Containers contain the whole kit required for an application, so the application can be run in an isolated way. For eg.- Suppose there is an image of Ubuntu OS with NGINX SERVER when this image is run with the docker run command, then a container will be created and NGINX SERVER will be running on Ubuntu OS. What is Docker Hub? Docker Hub is a repository service and it is a cloud-based service where people push their Docker Container Images and also pull the Docker Container Images from the Docker Hub anytime or anywhere via the internet. Generally it makes it easy to find and reuse images. It provides features such as you can push your images as private or public registry where you can store and share Docker images. Mainly DevOps team uses the Docker Hub. It is an open-source tool and freely available for all operating systems. It is like storage where we store the images and pull the images when it is required. When a person wants to push/pull images from the Docker Hub they must have a basic knowledge of Docker. Let us discuss the requirements of the Docker tool. What is Docker Compose? Docker Compose will execute a YAML-based multi-container application. The YAML file consists of all configurations needed to deploy containers Docker Compose , which is integrated with Docker Swarm , and provides directions for building and deploying containers. With Docker Compose, each container is constructed to run on a single host. How to Download Docker Desktop? Docker Desktop provides GUI to work on docker containers, docker images and docker networks. Docker desktop provides and separate environment which contains Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and other tools which are needed to build, ship and run the applications in the form of containers which makes it more user friendly. To know more how to install docker desktop refer to Docker Desktop Sample Image. Docker Commands Through introducing the essential docker commands, docker became a powerful software in streamlining the container management process. It helps in ensuring a seamless development and deployment workflows. The following are the some of docker commands that are used commonly: Docker Run: It used for launching the containers from images, with specifying the runtime options and commands. Docker Pull: It fetches the container images from the container registry like Docker Hub to the local machine. Docker ps : It helps in displaying the running containers along with their important information like container ID, image used and status. Docker Stop : It helps in halting the running containers gracefully shutting down the processes within them. Docker Start: It helps in restarting the stopped containers, resuming their operations from the previous state. Docker Login: It helps to login in to the docker registry enabling the access to private repositories. To Know more about the docker commands refer tot the Docker – Instruction Commands . Docker Engine The software that hosts the containers is named Docker Engine. Docker Engine is a client-server based application. The docker engine has 3 main components: Server: It is responsible for creating and managing Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes on the Docker. It is referred to as a daemon process. REST API : It specifies how the applications can interact with the Server and instructs it what to do. Client: The Client is a docker command-line interface (CLI), that allows us to interact with Docker using the docker commands. Why to use Docker? Docker can be used to pack the application and its dependencies which makes it lightweight and easy to ship the code faster with more reliability. Docker make its very simple to run the application in the production environment docker container can be platform independent if the docker engine is installed in the machine. Resource Efficiency : Docker helps in maximizing the resource utilization by running the multiple containers on a single host. It helps in reducing the infrastructure costs and improves the efficiency. Version Control: It simples the versioning for the applications and their dependencies ensuring the consistency and making easier of collaboration across the teams. Microservices Agility: It enables the adoption of microservices architecture, promoting the scalability, flexibility and fault isolation agile application development. What is Docker For AWS? Docker is the most powerful tool to run the application in the form of containers. Docker container are light in weight and can be run on any operating system. AWS provides the Amazon Elastic Container Service ( Amazon ECS ) it is an fully managed container service by which you can deploy, scale and manage the docker containers. Amazon ECS is the most reliable platform according to the performance and also it can be integrated with the other AWS Service like load balancing, service discovery, and container health monitoring. To know more about Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) . Difference Between Docker Containers and Virtual Machines The following are the differences between docker containers and Virtual Machines: Docker Containers Virtual Machines Docker Containers contain binaries, libraries, and configuration files along with the application itself. Virtual Machines (VMs) run on Hypervisors, which allow multiple Virtual Machines to run on a single machine along with its own operating system. They don’t contain a guest OS for each container and rely on the underlying OS kernel, which makes the containers lightweight. Each VM has its own copy of an operating system along with the application and necessary binaries, which makes it significantly larger and it requires more resources. Containers share resources with other containers in the same host OS and provide OS-level process isolation. They provide Hardware-level process isolation and are slow to boot. How to Install Docker On Ubuntu? A Step-By-Step Guide The following steps guide you in installation of docker on ubuntu: Step 1: Remove old version of Docker Execute the following command to remove the old versioned docker software: $ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc Step 2: Installing Docker Engine The following command is used for installation of docker engine: $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg \\ lsb-release $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg $ echo \\ \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin $ sudo groupadd docker $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Step 3: Verify Docker Installation Check if docker is successfully installed in your system by trying to run a container with the following command: $ sudo docker run hello-world To more detailing on the installation of docker on ubuntu, refer this – Article Sample Example: Containerizing Application Using Docker The following steps guides in containerizing the application using Docker: Step 1: Create Dokcerfile and Python Application Create a folder with 2 files (Dockerfile and main.py file) in it Step 2: Develop Python Code Edit main.py with the below code, or else you can try on developing your own python code. #!/usr/bin/env python3 print(\"Docker and GFG rock!\") Step 3: Develop a Dockerfile Edit Dockerfile with the below instructions for developing the Dockerfile: FROM python:latest COPY main.py / CMD [ \"python\", \"./main.py\" ] Step 4: Create a Docker Image Once you have created and edited the main.py file and the Dockerfile, create your image contain your application by running the following command: $ sudo docker build -t python-test .

Also, we went through the installation of Docker on our systems. We created an application using Docker and pushed our image to Docker Hub. Lastly, we learned how we could remove a particular image from our local system and later pull the image from Docker Hub if it doesn’t exist locally. Docker – FAQs What is Docker Hub in short? Docker Hub is a public registry where user/developers can store and share system images created by them and making them to easily access and reuse images for other software developers. What is needed to use Docker Hub? To use Docker Hub user should have an account on Docker Hub platform. If you don’t have an account on Docker Hub you can create one by singing up. Once you have an account on Docker, then you can perform operations like push and pull images to and from Docker Hub. What are Docker Logs? Docker daemon and Docker containers will generate the docker logs in the form of text messages which will helps you in further to troubleshoot problems, monitor the performance of your applications, and gather information about the state of your Docker environment. What is Docker Build? Docker build is an command which is used to build the docker image by using the Dockerfile.

Introduction Docker concepts Docker workshop Educational resources Home / Get started / What is Docker? What is Docker? Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. The Docker platform Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers: Develop your application and its supporting components using containers. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application. When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two. What can I use Docker for? Fast, consistent delivery of your applications Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Consider the following example scenario: Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run automated and manual tests. When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment. Responsive deployment and scaling Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments. Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. Running more workloads on the same hardware Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources. Docker architecture Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers. The Docker daemon The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services. The Docker client The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon. Docker Desktop Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see Docker Desktop. Docker registries A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes your image to your configured registry. Docker objects When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects. Images An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies. Containers A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine. A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear. Example docker run command The following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs /bin/bash. $ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration): If you don't have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create command manually. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machine's network connection. Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash. Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to your terminal. When you run exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container stops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it. The underlying technology Docker is written in the Go programming language and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers – images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging. Docker containers that run on Docker Engine: Standard: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere Lightweight: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry Learn more Docker Containers Are Everywhere: Linux, Windows, Data center, Cloud, Serverless, etc. Docker container technology was launched in 2013 as an open source Docker Engine. It leveraged existing computing concepts around containers and specifically in the Linux world, primitives known as cgroups and namespaces. Docker’s technology is unique because it focuses on the requirements of developers and systems operators to separate application dependencies from infrastructure. Success in the Linux world drove a partnership with Microsoft that brought Docker containers and its functionality to Windows Server. Technology available from Docker and its open source project, Moby has been leveraged by all major data center vendors and cloud providers. Many of these providers are leveraging Docker for their container-native IaaS offerings. Additionally, the leading open source serverless frameworks utilize Docker container technology. Comparing Containers and Virtual Machines Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient. CONTAINERS Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems. VIRTUAL MACHINES Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries – taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot. Containers and Virtual Machines Together Containers and VMs used together provide a great deal of flexibility in deploying and managing app Container Standards and Industry Leadership The launch of Docker in 2013 jump started a revolution in application development – by democratizing software containers. Docker developed a Linux container technology – one that is portable, flexible and easy to deploy. Docker open sourced libcontainer and partnered with a worldwide community of contributors to further its development. In June 2015, Docker donated the container image specification and runtime code now known as runc, to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) to help establish standardization as the container ecosystem grows and matures. Following this evolution, Docker continues to give back with the containerd project, which Docker donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2017. containerd is an industry-standard container runtime that leverages runc and was created with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability. containerd is the core container runtime of the Docker Engine.

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. It was launched in 2013 by a company called Dotcloud, Inc which was later renamed Docker, Inc. It is written in the Go language. It has been just six years since Docker was launched yet communities have already shifted to it from VMs. Docker is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators making it a part of many DevOps toolchains. Developers can write code without worrying about the testing and production environment. Sysadmins need not worry about infrastructure as Docker can easily scale up and scale down the number of systems. Docker comes into play at the deployment stage of the software development cycle. Containerization Containerization is OS-based virtualization that creates multiple virtual units in the userspace, known as Containers. Containers share the same host kernel but are isolated from each other through private namespaces and resource control mechanisms at the OS level. Container-based Virtualization provides a different level of abstraction in terms of virtualization and isolation when compared with hypervisors. Hypervisors use a lot of hardware which results in overhead in terms of virtualizing hardware and virtual device drivers. A full operating system (e.g -Linux, Windows) runs on top of this virtualized hardware in each virtual machine instance. But in contrast, containers implement isolation of processes at the operating system level, thus avoiding such overhead. These containers run on top of the same shared operating system kernel of the underlying host machine and one or more processes can be run within each container. In containers you don’t have to pre-allocate any RAM, it is allocated dynamically during the creation of containers while in VMs you need to first pre-allocate the memory and then create the virtual machine. Containerization has better resource utilization compared to VMs and a short boot-up process. It is the next evolution in virtualization. Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly easy development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems; on virtual machines or bare metal, on a developer’s machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public cloud. Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage, and network resources at the OS level, providing developers with a sandboxed view of the OS logically isolated from other applications. Docker is the most popular open-source container format available and is supported on Google Cloud Platform and by Google Kubernetes Engine. Docker Architecture Docker architecture consists of Docker client, Docker Daemon running on Docker Host, and Docker Hub repository. Docker has client-server architecture in which the client communicates with the Docker Daemon running on the Docker Host using a combination of REST APIs, Socket IO, and TCP. If we have to build the Docker image, then we use the client to execute the build command to Docker Daemon then Docker Daemon builds an image based on given inputs and saves it into the Docker registry. If you don’t want to create an image then just execute the pull command from the client and then Docker Daemon will pull the image from the Docker Hub finally if we want to run the image then execute the run command from the client which will create the container. Components of Docker The main components of Docker include – Docker clients and servers, Docker images, Dockerfile, Docker Registries, and Docker containers. These components are explained in detail in the below section : Docker Clients and Servers– Docker has a client-server architecture. The Docker Daemon/Server consists of all containers. The Docker Daemon/Server receives the request from the Docker client through CLI or REST APIs and thus processes the request accordingly. Docker client and Daemon can be present on the same host or different host. Docker Images– Docker images are used to build docker containers by using a read-only template. The foundation of every image is a base image eg. base images such as – ubuntu14.04 LTS, and Fedora 20. Base images can also be created from scratch and then required applications can be added to the base image by modifying it thus this process of creating a new image is called “committing the change”. Docker File– Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build your Docker image. This image contains all the project code and its dependencies. The same Docker image can be used to spin ‘n’ number of containers each with modification to the underlying image. The final image can be uploaded to Docker Hub and shared among various collaborators for testing and deployment. The set of commands that you need to use in your Docker File is FROM, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, VOLUME, ENV, and many more. Docker Registries– Docker Registry is a storage component for Docker images. We can store the images in either public/private repositories so that multiple users can collaborate in building the application. Docker Hub is Docker’s cloud repository. Docker Hub is called a public registry where everyone can pull available images and push their images without creating an image from scratch. Docker Containers– Docker Containers are runtime instances of Docker images. Containers contain the whole kit required for an application, so the application can be run in an isolated way. For eg.- Suppose there is an image of Ubuntu OS with NGINX SERVER when this image is run with the docker run command, then a container will be created and NGINX SERVER will be running on Ubuntu OS. Docker Compose Docker Compose is a tool with which we can create a multi-container application. It makes it easier to configure and run applications made up of multiple containers. For example, suppose you had an application that required WordPress and MySQL, you could create one file which would start both the containers as a service without the need to start each one separately. We define a multi-container application in a YAML file. With the docker-compose-up command, we can start the application in the foreground. Docker-compose will look for the docker-compose. YAML file in the current folder to start the application. By adding the -d option to the docker-compose-up command, we can start the application in the background. Creating a docker-compose. YAML file for WordPress application : #cat docker-compose.yaml version: ’2’ services: db: image: mysql:5.7 volumes:db_data:/var/lib/mysql restart: always environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: WordPress MYSQL_DATABASE: WordPress MYSQL_USER: WordPress MYSQL_PASSWORD: WordPress WordPress: depends_on: - DB image: WordPress:latest ports: - \"8000:80\" restart: always environment: WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306 WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress volumes: db_data: In this docker-compose. YAML file, we have the following ports section for the WordPress container, which means that we are going to map the host’s 8000 port with the container’s 80 port. So that host can access the application with its IP and port no. Docker Networks When we create and run a container, Docker by itself assigns an IP address to it, by default. Most of the time, it is required to create and deploy Docker networks as per our needs. So, Docker let us design the network as per our requirements. There are three types of Docker networks- default networks, user-defined networks, and overlay networks. To get a list of all the default networks that Docker creates, we run the command shown below – There are three types of networks in Docker – Bridged network: When a new Docker container is created without the –network argument, Docker by default connects the container with the bridge network. In bridged networks, all the containers in a single host can connect through their IP addresses. A Bridge network is created when the span of Docker hosts is one i.e. when all containers run on a single host. We need an overlay network to create a network that has a span of more than one Docker host. Host network: When a new Docker container is created with the –network=host argument it pushes the container into the host network stack where the Docker daemon is running. All interfaces of the host are accessible from the container which is assigned to the host network. None network: When a new Docker container is created with the –network=none argument it puts the Docker container in its network stack. So, in this none network, no IP addresses are assigned to the container, because of which they cannot communicate with each other. We can assign any one of the networks to the Docker containers. The –network option of the ‘docker run’ command is used to assign a specific network to the container. $docker run --network =\"network name\" To get detailed information about a particular network we use the command- $docker network inspect \"network name\" Advantages of Docker – Docker has become popular nowadays because of the benefits provided by Docker containers. The main advantages of Docker are: Speed – The speed of Docker containers compared to a virtual machine is very fast. The time required to build a container is very fast because they are tiny and lightweight. Development, testing, and deployment can be done faster as containers are small. Containers can be pushed for testing once they have been built and then from there on to the production environment. Portability – The applications that are built inside docker containers are extremely portable. These portable applications can easily be moved anywhere as a single element and their performance also remains the same. Scalability – Docker has the ability that it can be deployed on several physical servers, data servers, and cloud platforms. It can also be run on every Linux machine. Containers can easily be moved from a cloud environment to a local host and from there back to the cloud again at a fast pace. Density – Docker uses the resources that are available more efficiently because it does not use a hypervisor. This is the reason that more containers can be run on a single host as compared to virtual machines. Docker Containers have higher performance because of their high density and no overhead wastage of resources.

The Docker client talks with the docker daemon which helps in building, running, and distributing the docker containers. The Docker client runs with the daemon on the same system or we can connect the Docker client with the Docker daemon remotely. With the help of REST API over a UNIX socket or a network, the docker client and daemon interact with each other. What is Docker Daemon? Docker daemon manages all the services by communicating with other daemons. It manages docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes with the help of the API requests of Docker. Docker Client With the help of the docker client, the docker users can interact with the docker. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with multiple daemons. When a docker client runs any docker command on the docker terminal then the terminal sends instructions to the daemon. The Docker daemon gets those instructions from the docker client withinside the shape of the command and REST API’s request. The main objective of the docker client is to provide a way to direct the pull of images from the docker registry and run them on the docker host. The common commands which are used by clients are docker build, docker pull, and docker run. Docker Host A Docker host is a type of machine that is responsible for running more than one container. It comprises the Docker daemon, Images, Containers, Networks, and Storage. Docker Registry All the docker images are stored in the docker registry. There is a public registry which is known as a docker hub that can be used by anyone. We can run our private registry also. With the help of docker run or docker pull commands, we can pull the required images from our configured registry. Images are pushed into configured registry with the help of the docker push command. Docker Objects Whenever we are using a docker, we are creating and use images, containers, volumes, networks, and other objects. Now, we are going to discuss docker objects:- Docker Images An image contains instructions for creating a docker container. It is just a read-only template. It is used to store and ship applications. Images are an important part of the docker experience as they enable collaboration between developers in any way which is not possible earlier. Docker Containers Containers are created from docker images as they are ready applications. With the help of Docker API or CLI, we can start, stop, delete, or move a container. A container can access only those resources which are defined in the image unless additional access is defined during the building of an image in the container. Docker Storage We can store data within the writable layer of the container but it requires a storage driver. Storage driver controls and manages the images and containers on our docker host. Types of Docker Storage Data Volumes: Data Volumes can be mounted directly into the filesystem of the container and are essentially directories or files on the Docker Host filesystem. Volume Container: In order to maintain the state of the containers (data) produced by the running container, Docker volumes file systems are mounted on Docker containers. independent container life cycle, the volumes are stored on the host. This makes it simple for users to exchange file systems among containers and backup data. Directory Mounts: A host directory that is mounted as a volume in your container might be specified. Storage Plugins: Docker volume plugins enable us to integrate the Docker containers with external volumes like Amazon EBS by this we can maintain the state of the container. Docker Networking Docker networking provides complete isolation for docker containers. It means a user can link a docker container to many networks. It requires very less OS instances to run the workload. Types of Docker Network Bridge: It is the default network driver. We can use this when different containers communicate with the same docker host. Host: When you don’t need any isolation between the container and host then it is used. Overlay: For communication with each other, it will enable the swarm services. None: It disables all networking. macvlan: This network assigns MAC(Media Access control) address to the containers which look like a physical address.

Introduction Docker concepts Docker workshop Educational resources Home / Get started / What is Docker? What is Docker? Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. The Docker platform Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers: Develop your application and its supporting components using containers. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application. When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two. What can I use Docker for? Fast, consistent delivery of your applications Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Consider the following example scenario: Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers. They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run automated and manual tests. When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation. When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment. Responsive deployment and scaling Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments. Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time. Running more workloads on the same hardware Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources. Docker architecture Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers. The Docker daemon The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services. The Docker client The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon. Docker Desktop Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see Docker Desktop. Docker registries A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry. When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, Docker pushes your image to your configured registry. Docker objects When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects. Images An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run. You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies. Containers A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state. By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine. A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear. Example docker run command The following command runs an ubuntu container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs /bin/bash. $ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration): If you don't have the ubuntu image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run docker pull ubuntu manually. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a docker container create command manually. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machine's network connection. Docker starts the container and executes /bin/bash. Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the -i and -t flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to your terminal. When you run exit to terminate the /bin/bash command, the container stops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it. The underlying technology Docker is written in the Go programming language and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container. These namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.

What is Podman Desktop? Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo Podman vs. Docker Why Podman? Red Hat can help Overview Podman (short for pod manager) is an open source tool for developing, managing, and running containers. Developed by Red Hat® engineers along with the open source community, Podman manages the entire container ecosystem using the libpod library. Podman’s daemonless and inclusive architecture makes it an accessible, security-focused option for container management. Its accompanying tools and features, such as Buildah and Skopeo, let developers customize their container environments to suit their needs. Developers can also take advantage of Podman Desktop, a graphical user interface (GUI) for using Podman in local environments. Users can run Podman on various Linux® distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, and Ubuntu.

Pods are groups of containers that run together and share the same resources, similar to Kubernetes pods. Podman manages these pods via a simple command-line interface (CLI) and the libpod library, which provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes. Podman's CLI creates and supports Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers, which are designed to meet industry standards for container runtimes and formats. More advanced building capabilities are available in the related project, Buildah. Each pod is composed of 1 infra container and any number of regular containers. The infra container keeps the pod running and maintains user namespaces, which isolate containers from the host. The other containers each have a monitor to keep track of their processes and look out for dead containers―nonfunctioning containers that can’t be taken out of the environment because some of their resources are still being used. Red Hat to Contribute Comprehensive Container Tools Collection to Cloud Native Computing Foundation Read the blog post What makes Podman different from other container engines? Podman stands out from other container engines because it’s daemonless, meaning it doesn't rely on a process with root privileges to run containers. Daemons are processes that run in the background of your system to do the work of running containers without a user interface. Think of daemons as the intermediary communicating between the user and the container itself. While daemons can be a convenient way to manage your container environment, they can also introduce security vulnerabilities. Many daemons run with root privileges. In Linux systems, the root account acts as a superuser with administrative access (while bypassing the need for admin verification) to read files, install programs, edit applications, and more. This makes daemons an ideal target for hackers who want to gain control of your containers and infiltrate the host system. Podman cuts out the daemon and lets regular users run containers without interacting with a root-owned daemon, or allows for the use of rootless containers. By going rootless, users can create, run, and manage containers without requiring processes with admin privileges, making your container environment more accessible while reducing security risks. Additionally, Podman launches each container with a Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) label, giving administrators more control over what resources and capabilities are provided to container processes. How does Podman manage containers? Users can invoke Podman from the command line to pull containers from a repository and run them. Podman calls the configured container runtime to create the running container. But without a dedicated daemon, Podman uses systemd—a system and service manager for Linux operating systems—to make updates and keep containers running in the background. By integrating systemd and Podman, you can generate control units for your containers and run them with systemd automatically enabled. Users can control the automatic starting and managing of their containers through their own repositories on the system or using systemd units. Allowing users to manage their own resources, and running containers rootlessly, can remove the temptation to add privileges like write access to areas of the system that shouldn’t have them. This also ensures that every user has separate sets of containers and images and can use Podman concurrently on the same host without interfering with each other. When users finish their work, they can push changes to a common registry to share their image with others. Podman also deploys a RESTful API (REST API) to manage containers. REST stands for representational state transfer. A REST API is an API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. With the REST API, you can call Podman from platforms such as cURL, Postman, Google's Advanced REST client, and many others. Try these 5 Podman features now What is Podman Desktop? Podman Desktop is a GUI for Podman, which provides a central place for developers to work with containers right on their laptop or workstation. Developers can build, push, and pull images and manage Podman resources directly using a GUI that’s consistent across local Linux, Windows, and macOS environments. Podman Desktop also lets developers deliver ready-to-deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes environments. Podman Desktop supports extension packs, which open up additional capabilities. One example, Podman AI Lab, adds recipes for building applications that work with large language models (LLMs) in a local environment and includes a curated catalog of open source-licensed LLMs. Another example is the Red Hat extension pack for Podman Desktop, which helps developers work with specific Red Hat technologies such as Red Hat OpenShift®. Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo Podman is a modular container engine, so it must work alongside tools like Buildah and Skopeo to build and move its containers. With Buildah, you can build containers either from scratch or by using an image as a starting point. Skopeo moves container images between different types of storage systems, allowing you to copy images between registries like docker.io, quay.io, and your internal registry or between different types of storage on your local system. This modular approach to containerization results in a flexible, lightweight environment by reducing overhead and isolating the features you need. Working with containers makes it possible to use smaller, more modular tools that can focus on a single purpose and be updated as often as needed. Think of Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo as a set of specialized Swiss Army knives. Combined, they can satisfy almost all container use cases. Podman is the biggest of these knives. Podman and Buildah use runC―the OCI runtime―by default to launch containers. You can use runC to build and run an image, or you can use it to run Docker-formatted images. This Go language-based tool reads a runtime specification, configures the Linux kernel, and eventually creates and starts container processes. With some configuration changes, you can also use Podman with other footprints like crun. Build UBI containers in GitHub Actions with Buildah and Podman Podman vs. Docker Docker is a containerization technology that allows the creation and use of Linux containers. The main difference between Podman and Docker is Podman’s daemonless architecture. Podman containers have always been rootless, while Docker only recently added a rootless mode to its daemon configuration. Docker is an all-in-1 tool for container creation and management, whereas Podman and its associated tools like Buildah and Skopeo are more specialized for specific aspects of containerization. This makes it possible to customize your environments with only the tools you need. Podman is a powerful alternative to Docker, but the 2 can also work together. Users can easily switch between them by aliasing Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) and vice versa. Additionally, an rpm called podman-docker can drop a “docker” into the system application path, which calls Podman for those environments where the “docker” command is needed, easing the transition from Docker. Podman’s CLI is similar to Docker’s, so users who are familiar with one are likely to have success with the other. Some developers combine Podman and Docker, using Docker during the development stage and transferring their program to Podman in runtime environments. Podman is best suited for developers running containers without Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For Kubernetes container orchestration, developers can use the open source, community-driven container engine CRI-O. Check out this video on rootless containers with Podman Why Podman? Podman changed the container landscape by offering the same high-performance capabilities as leading container engines, but with the flexibility, accessibility, and security features that many development teams are seeking. Podman can help you: Manage container images and the full container lifecycle, including running, networking, checkpointing, and removing containers. Run and isolate resources for rootless containers and pods. Support OCI and Docker images as well as a Docker-compatible CLI. Create a daemonless environment to improve security and reduce idle resource consumption. Deploy a REST API to support Podman’s advanced functionality. Implement checkpoint/restore functionality for Linux containers with Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU). CRIU can freeze a running container and save its memory contents and state to disk so that containerized workloads can be restarted faster. Automatically update containers. Podman detects if an updated container fails to start and automatically rolls back to the last working version. This provides new levels of reliability for applications. Get hands on with Podman in this tutorial scenario Configure a rootless Podman service Red Hat can help Podman is included with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription so you can run OCI-compliant containers that are built using a trusted, supportable, and reliable universal base image (UBI). Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a standard for running Linux containers in enterprise environments. It allows developers to easily spin up containers, manage deployment, and speed development of new applications. Upgrading your Red Hat Enterprise Linux infrastructure ensures that you're ready to take full advantage of these benefits. With portable applications and containers built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux across open hybrid cloud environments, your organization can remain agile and continue to transform as your goals evolve. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux web console simplifies the deployment and daily administration of your systems with an easy-to-use web interface. Podman is available as a component of the web console to help you manage containers and images. Monitor how much CPU and memory your containers use by accessing container hosts and monitoring system loads in the web console’s dashboard. The web console also lets you simplify common tasks and complex operations to streamline container management. By using Ansible Playbooks, Red Hat Ansible® Automation Platform allows you to automate Podman functions like installation, container deployment, and other tasks that frequently consume time and resources. Podman, Podman Desktop, and other open standards-based container tools make Red Hat Enterprise Linux a powerful container host that delivers production-grade support, stability, and security features as well as a path forward to Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.

            "body": "Introduction Containers simplify the production, distribution, discoverability, and usage of applications with all of their dependencies and default configuration files. Users test drive or deploy a new application with one or two commands instead of following pages of installation instructions. Here’s how to find your first Container Image: podman search docker.io/busybox Output: NAME DESCRIPTION docker.io/library/busybox Busybox base image. docker.io/rancher/busybox docker.io/openebs/busybox-client docker.io/antrea/busybox docker.io/hugegraph/busybox test image ... The previous command returned a list of publicly available container images on DockerHub. These container images are easy to consume, but of differing levels of quality and maintenance. Let’s use the first one listed because it seems to be well maintained. To run the busybox container image, it’s just a single command: podman run -it docker.io/library/busybox Output: / # You can poke around in the busybox container for a while, but you’ll quickly find that running small container with a few Linux utilities in it provides limited value, so exit out: exit There’s an old saying that “nobody runs an operating system just to run an operating system” and the same is true with containers. It’s the workload running on top of an operating system or in a container that’s interesting and valuable. Sometimes we can find a publicly available container image for the exact workload we’re looking for and it will already be packaged exactly how we want. But, more often than not, there’s something that we want to add, remove, or customize. It can be as simple as a configuration setting for security or performance, or as complex as adding a complex workload. Either way, containers make it fairly easy to make the changes we need. Container Images aren’t actually images, they’re repositories often made up of multiple layers. These layers can easily be added, saved, and shared with others by using a Containerfile (Dockerfile). This single file often contains all the instructions needed to build a new container image and can easily be shared with others publicly using tools like GitHub. Here’s an example of how to build a Nginx web server on top of a Debian base image using the Dockerfile maintained by Nginx and published in GitHub: podman build -t nginx https://git.io/Jf8ol Once, the image build completes, it’s easy to run the new image from our local cache: podman run -d -p 8080:80 nginx curl localhost:8080 Output: ... <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p> ... Building new images is great, but sharing our work with others lets them review our work, critique how we built them, and offer improved versions. Our newly built Nginx image can be published at quay.io or docker.io to share it with the world. Everything needed to run the Nginx application is provided in the container image. Others can easily pull it down and use it, or make improvements to it. Standardizing on container images and Container Registries enable a new level of collaboration through simple consumption. This simple consumption model is possible because every major Container Engine and Registry Server uses the Open Containers Initiative (OCI) format. This allows users to find, run, build, share and deploy containers anywhere they want. Podman and other Container Engines like CRI-O, Docker, or containerd can create and consume container images from docker.io, quay.io, an on premise registry or even one provided by a cloud provider. The OCI image format facilitates this ecosystem through a single standard. For example, if we wanted to share our newly built Nginx container image on quay.io it’s easy. First log in to quay: podman login quay.io Input: Username: USERNAME Password: ******** Login Succeeded! Next, tag the image so that we can push it into our user account: podman tag localhost/nginx quay.io/USERNAME/nginx Finally, push the image: podman push quay.io/USERNAME/nginx Output: Getting image source signatures Copying blob 38c40d6c2c85 done Copying blob fee76a531659 done Copying blob c2adabaecedb done Copying config 7f3589c0b8 done Writing manifest to image destination Copying config 7f3589c0b8 done Writing manifest to image destination Storing signatures Notice that we pushed four layers to our registry and now it’s available for others to share. Take a quick look: podman inspect quay.io/USERNAME/nginx Output: [ { \"Id\": \"7f3589c0b8849a9e1ff52ceb0fcea2390e2731db9d1a7358c2f5fad216a48263\", \"Digest\": \"sha256:7822b5ba4c2eaabdd0ff3812277cfafa8a25527d1e234be028ed381a43ad5498\", \"RepoTags\": [ \"quay.io/USERNAME/nginx:latest\", ... To summarize, Podman makes it easy to find, run, build and share containers. Find: whether finding a container on dockerhub.io or quay.io, an internal registry server, or directly from a vendor, a couple of podman search, and podman pull commands make it easy Run: it’s easy to consume pre-built images with everything needed to run an entire application, or start from a Linux distribution base image with the podman run command Build: creating new layers with small tweaks, or major overhauls is easy with podman build Share: Podman lets you push your newly built containers anywhere you want with a single podman push command For more instructions on use cases, take a look at our Tutorials page.

Podman’s daemonless and inclusive architecture makes it an accessible, security-focused option for container management. Its accompanying tools and features, such as Buildah and Skopeo, let developers customize their container environments to suit their needs. Developers can also take advantage of Podman Desktop, a graphical user interface (GUI) for using Podman in local environments. Users can run Podman on various Linux® distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, and Ubuntu.

Pods are groups of containers that run together and share the same resources, similar to Kubernetes pods. Podman manages these pods via a simple command-line interface (CLI) and the libpod library, which provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes. Podman's CLI creates and supports Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers, which are designed to meet industry standards for container runtimes and formats. More advanced building capabilities are available in the related project, Buildah. Each pod is composed of 1 infra container and any number of regular containers. The infra container keeps the pod running and maintains user namespaces, which isolate containers from the host. The other containers each have a monitor to keep track of their processes and look out for dead containers―nonfunctioning containers that can’t be taken out of the environment because some of their resources are still being used. Red Hat to Contribute Comprehensive Container Tools Collection to Cloud Native Computing Foundation Read the blog post What makes Podman different from other container engines? Podman stands out from other container engines because it’s daemonless, meaning it doesn't rely on a process with root privileges to run containers. Daemons are processes that run in the background of your system to do the work of running containers without a user interface. Think of daemons as the intermediary communicating between the user and the container itself. While daemons can be a convenient way to manage your container environment, they can also introduce security vulnerabilities. Many daemons run with root privileges. In Linux systems, the root account acts as a superuser with administrative access (while bypassing the need for admin verification) to read files, install programs, edit applications, and more. This makes daemons an ideal target for hackers who want to gain control of your containers and infiltrate the host system. Podman cuts out the daemon and lets regular users run containers without interacting with a root-owned daemon, or allows for the use of rootless containers. By going rootless, users can create, run, and manage containers without requiring processes with admin privileges, making your container environment more accessible while reducing security risks. Additionally, Podman launches each container with a Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) label, giving administrators more control over what resources and capabilities are provided to container processes. How does Podman manage containers? Users can invoke Podman from the command line to pull containers from a repository and run them. Podman calls the configured container runtime to create the running container. But without a dedicated daemon, Podman uses systemd—a system and service manager for Linux operating systems—to make updates and keep containers running in the background. By integrating systemd and Podman, you can generate control units for your containers and run them with systemd automatically enabled. Users can control the automatic starting and managing of their containers through their own repositories on the system or using systemd units. Allowing users to manage their own resources, and running containers rootlessly, can remove the temptation to add privileges like write access to areas of the system that shouldn’t have them. This also ensures that every user has separate sets of containers and images and can use Podman concurrently on the same host without interfering with each other. When users finish their work, they can push changes to a common registry to share their image with others. Podman also deploys a RESTful API (REST API) to manage containers. REST stands for representational state transfer. A REST API is an API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. With the REST API, you can call Podman from platforms such as cURL, Postman, Google's Advanced REST client, and many others. Try these 5 Podman features now What is Podman Desktop? Podman Desktop is a GUI for Podman, which provides a central place for developers to work with containers right on their laptop or workstation. Developers can build, push, and pull images and manage Podman resources directly using a GUI that’s consistent across local Linux, Windows, and macOS environments. Podman Desktop also lets developers deliver ready-to-deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes environments. Podman Desktop supports extension packs, which open up additional capabilities. One example, Podman AI Lab, adds recipes for building applications that work with large language models (LLMs) in a local environment and includes a curated catalog of open source-licensed LLMs. Another example is the Red Hat extension pack for Podman Desktop, which helps developers work with specific Red Hat technologies such as Red Hat OpenShift®. Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo Podman is a modular container engine, so it must work alongside tools like Buildah and Skopeo to build and move its containers. With Buildah, you can build containers either from scratch or by using an image as a starting point. Skopeo moves container images between different types of storage systems, allowing you to copy images between registries like docker.io, quay.io, and your internal registry or between different types of storage on your local system. This modular approach to containerization results in a flexible, lightweight environment by reducing overhead and isolating the features you need. Working with containers makes it possible to use smaller, more modular tools that can focus on a single purpose and be updated as often as needed. Think of Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo as a set of specialized Swiss Army knives. Combined, they can satisfy almost all container use cases. Podman is the biggest of these knives. Podman and Buildah use runC―the OCI runtime―by default to launch containers. You can use runC to build and run an image, or you can use it to run Docker-formatted images. This Go language-based tool reads a runtime specification, configures the Linux kernel, and eventually creates and starts container processes. With some configuration changes, you can also use Podman with other footprints like crun. Build UBI containers in GitHub Actions with Buildah and Podman Podman vs. Docker Docker is a containerization technology that allows the creation and use of Linux containers. The main difference between Podman and Docker is Podman’s daemonless architecture. Podman containers have always been rootless, while Docker only recently added a rootless mode to its daemon configuration. Docker is an all-in-1 tool for container creation and management, whereas Podman and its associated tools like Buildah and Skopeo are more specialized for specific aspects of containerization. This makes it possible to customize your environments with only the tools you need. Podman is a powerful alternative to Docker, but the 2 can also work together. Users can easily switch between them by aliasing Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) and vice versa. Additionally, an rpm called podman-docker can drop a “docker” into the system application path, which calls Podman for those environments where the “docker” command is needed, easing the transition from Docker. Podman’s CLI is similar to Docker’s, so users who are familiar with one are likely to have success with the other. Some developers combine Podman and Docker, using Docker during the development stage and transferring their program to Podman in runtime environments. Podman is best suited for developers running containers without Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For Kubernetes container orchestration, developers can use the open source, community-driven container engine CRI-O. Check out this video on rootless containers with Podman Why Podman? Podman changed the container landscape by offering the same high-performance capabilities as leading container engines, but with the flexibility, accessibility, and security features that many development teams are seeking. Podman can help you: Manage container images and the full container lifecycle, including running, networking, checkpointing, and removing containers. Run and isolate resources for rootless containers and pods. Support OCI and Docker images as well as a Docker-compatible CLI. Create a daemonless environment to improve security and reduce idle resource consumption. Deploy a REST API to support Podman’s advanced functionality. Implement checkpoint/restore functionality for Linux containers with Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU). CRIU can freeze a running container and save its memory contents and state to disk so that containerized workloads can be restarted faster. Automatically update containers. Podman detects if an updated container fails to start and automatically rolls back to the last working version. This provides new levels of reliability for applications. Get hands on with Podman in this tutorial scenario Configure a rootless Podman service Red Hat can help Podman is included with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription so you can run OCI-compliant containers that are built using a trusted, supportable, and reliable universal base image (UBI).

Pod Support: Pods are lightweight groups where one or more containers can share resources and can be managed as a single unit. Compatibility with Docker: Podman is compatible with Docker. You can use similar Docker and Docker Compose commands to manage Podman containers. What is Docker? Docker is a popular container management tool similar to Podman which is used for developing, testing, and deploying web applications. Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS). It is used for running microservices, which are small, independent applications that can be combined to create a larger application. Docker containers are lightweight and portable so you can run on any operating system platform such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. Docker use operating-system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes docker a secure and efficient way to run applications. Key Features of Docker Improved Productivity: consistent building and testing applications. Faster Deployment: Docker containers can quickly and easily be deployed on any OS platform. Efficient Resource Utilization: Docker containers are lightweight and isolate resources. which can help to improve the utilization of hardware resources.

What is Podman Desktop? Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo Podman vs. Docker Why Podman? Red Hat can help Overview Podman (short for pod manager) is an open source tool for developing, managing, and running containers. Developed by Red Hat® engineers along with the open source community, Podman manages the entire container ecosystem using the libpod library. Podman’s daemonless and inclusive architecture makes it an accessible, security-focused option for container management. Its accompanying tools and features, such as Buildah and Skopeo, let developers customize their container environments to suit their needs. Developers can also take advantage of Podman Desktop, a graphical user interface (GUI) for using Podman in local environments. Users can run Podman on various Linux® distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, and Ubuntu.

Pods are groups of containers that run together and share the same resources, similar to Kubernetes pods. Podman manages these pods via a simple command-line interface (CLI) and the libpod library, which provides application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes. Podman's CLI creates and supports Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers, which are designed to meet industry standards for container runtimes and formats. More advanced building capabilities are available in the related project, Buildah. Each pod is composed of 1 infra container and any number of regular containers. The infra container keeps the pod running and maintains user namespaces, which isolate containers from the host. The other containers each have a monitor to keep track of their processes and look out for dead containers―nonfunctioning containers that can’t be taken out of the environment because some of their resources are still being used. Red Hat to Contribute Comprehensive Container Tools Collection to Cloud Native Computing Foundation Read the blog post What makes Podman different from other container engines? Podman stands out from other container engines because it’s daemonless, meaning it doesn't rely on a process with root privileges to run containers. Daemons are processes that run in the background of your system to do the work of running containers without a user interface. Think of daemons as the intermediary communicating between the user and the container itself. While daemons can be a convenient way to manage your container environment, they can also introduce security vulnerabilities. Many daemons run with root privileges. In Linux systems, the root account acts as a superuser with administrative access (while bypassing the need for admin verification) to read files, install programs, edit applications, and more. This makes daemons an ideal target for hackers who want to gain control of your containers and infiltrate the host system. Podman cuts out the daemon and lets regular users run containers without interacting with a root-owned daemon, or allows for the use of rootless containers. By going rootless, users can create, run, and manage containers without requiring processes with admin privileges, making your container environment more accessible while reducing security risks. Additionally, Podman launches each container with a Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) label, giving administrators more control over what resources and capabilities are provided to container processes. How does Podman manage containers? Users can invoke Podman from the command line to pull containers from a repository and run them. Podman calls the configured container runtime to create the running container. But without a dedicated daemon, Podman uses systemd—a system and service manager for Linux operating systems—to make updates and keep containers running in the background. By integrating systemd and Podman, you can generate control units for your containers and run them with systemd automatically enabled. Users can control the automatic starting and managing of their containers through their own repositories on the system or using systemd units. Allowing users to manage their own resources, and running containers rootlessly, can remove the temptation to add privileges like write access to areas of the system that shouldn’t have them. This also ensures that every user has separate sets of containers and images and can use Podman concurrently on the same host without interfering with each other. When users finish their work, they can push changes to a common registry to share their image with others. Podman also deploys a RESTful API (REST API) to manage containers. REST stands for representational state transfer. A REST API is an API that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. With the REST API, you can call Podman from platforms such as cURL, Postman, Google's Advanced REST client, and many others. Try these 5 Podman features now What is Podman Desktop? Podman Desktop is a GUI for Podman, which provides a central place for developers to work with containers right on their laptop or workstation. Developers can build, push, and pull images and manage Podman resources directly using a GUI that’s consistent across local Linux, Windows, and macOS environments. Podman Desktop also lets developers deliver ready-to-deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes environments. Podman Desktop supports extension packs, which open up additional capabilities. One example, Podman AI Lab, adds recipes for building applications that work with large language models (LLMs) in a local environment and includes a curated catalog of open source-licensed LLMs. Another example is the Red Hat extension pack for Podman Desktop, which helps developers work with specific Red Hat technologies such as Red Hat OpenShift®. Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo Podman is a modular container engine, so it must work alongside tools like Buildah and Skopeo to build and move its containers. With Buildah, you can build containers either from scratch or by using an image as a starting point. Skopeo moves container images between different types of storage systems, allowing you to copy images between registries like docker.io, quay.io, and your internal registry or between different types of storage on your local system. This modular approach to containerization results in a flexible, lightweight environment by reducing overhead and isolating the features you need. Working with containers makes it possible to use smaller, more modular tools that can focus on a single purpose and be updated as often as needed. Think of Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo as a set of specialized Swiss Army knives. Combined, they can satisfy almost all container use cases. Podman is the biggest of these knives. Podman and Buildah use runC―the OCI runtime―by default to launch containers. You can use runC to build and run an image, or you can use it to run Docker-formatted images. This Go language-based tool reads a runtime specification, configures the Linux kernel, and eventually creates and starts container processes. With some configuration changes, you can also use Podman with other footprints like crun. Build UBI containers in GitHub Actions with Buildah and Podman Podman vs. Docker Docker is a containerization technology that allows the creation and use of Linux containers. The main difference between Podman and Docker is Podman’s daemonless architecture. Podman containers have always been rootless, while Docker only recently added a rootless mode to its daemon configuration. Docker is an all-in-1 tool for container creation and management, whereas Podman and its associated tools like Buildah and Skopeo are more specialized for specific aspects of containerization. This makes it possible to customize your environments with only the tools you need. Podman is a powerful alternative to Docker, but the 2 can also work together. Users can easily switch between them by aliasing Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) and vice versa. Additionally, an rpm called podman-docker can drop a “docker” into the system application path, which calls Podman for those environments where the “docker” command is needed, easing the transition from Docker. Podman’s CLI is similar to Docker’s, so users who are familiar with one are likely to have success with the other. Some developers combine Podman and Docker, using Docker during the development stage and transferring their program to Podman in runtime environments. Podman is best suited for developers running containers without Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For Kubernetes container orchestration, developers can use the open source, community-driven container engine CRI-O. Check out this video on rootless containers with Podman Why Podman? Podman changed the container landscape by offering the same high-performance capabilities as leading container engines, but with the flexibility, accessibility, and security features that many development teams are seeking. Podman can help you: Manage container images and the full container lifecycle, including running, networking, checkpointing, and removing containers. Run and isolate resources for rootless containers and pods. Support OCI and Docker images as well as a Docker-compatible CLI. Create a daemonless environment to improve security and reduce idle resource consumption. Deploy a REST API to support Podman’s advanced functionality. Implement checkpoint/restore functionality for Linux containers with Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU). CRIU can freeze a running container and save its memory contents and state to disk so that containerized workloads can be restarted faster. Automatically update containers. Podman detects if an updated container fails to start and automatically rolls back to the last working version. This provides new levels of reliability for applications. Get hands on with Podman in this tutorial scenario Configure a rootless Podman service Red Hat can help Podman is included with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription so you can run OCI-compliant containers that are built using a trusted, supportable, and reliable universal base image (UBI). Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a standard for running Linux containers in enterprise environments. It allows developers to easily spin up containers, manage deployment, and speed development of new applications. Upgrading your Red Hat Enterprise Linux infrastructure ensures that you're ready to take full advantage of these benefits. With portable applications and containers built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux across open hybrid cloud environments, your organization can remain agile and continue to transform as your goals evolve. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux web console simplifies the deployment and daily administration of your systems with an easy-to-use web interface. Podman is available as a component of the web console to help you manage containers and images. Monitor how much CPU and memory your containers use by accessing container hosts and monitoring system loads in the web console’s dashboard. The web console also lets you simplify common tasks and complex operations to streamline container management. By using Ansible Playbooks, Red Hat Ansible® Automation Platform allows you to automate Podman functions like installation, container deployment, and other tasks that frequently consume time and resources.

Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine. Containers under the control of Podman can either be run by root or by a non-privileged user. Podman manages the entire container ecosystem which includes pods, containers, container images, and container volumes using the libpod library. Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify OCI container images, such as pulling and tagging. It allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers and container images in a production environment. There is a RESTFul API to manage containers. We also have a remote Podman client that can interact with the RESTFul service. We currently support clients on Linux, Mac, and Windows. The RESTFul service is only supported on Linux. If you are completely new to containers, we recommend that you check out the Introduction. For power users or those coming from Docker, check out our Tutorials. For advanced users and contributors, you can get very detailed information about the Podman CLI by looking at our Commands page. Finally, for Developers looking at how to interact with the Podman API, please see our API documentation Reference.

And when they run containers in their development runtimes, they do not even think about the role pods could play—even in a localized runtime. Most people coming from the Docker world of running single containers do not envision the concept of running pods. There are several good reasons to consider using pods locally, other than using pods to naturally group your containers. For example, suppose you have multiple containers that require the use of a MariaDB container. But you would prefer not to bind that database to a routable network, either in your bridge or further. Using a pod, you could bind to the localhost address of the pod and all containers in that pod will be able to connect to it because of the shared network name space. Podman Pods: what you need to know The Pod concept was introduced by Kubernetes. Podman pods are similar to the Kubernetes definition. Every Podman pod includes an \"infra\" container. This container does nothing, but go to sleep. Its purpose is to hold the namespaces associated with the pod and allow podman to connect other containers to the pod. This allows you to start and stop containers within the POD and the pod will stay running, where as if the primary container controlled the pod, this would not be possible. The default infra container is based on the k8s.gcr.io/pause image, Unless you explicitly say otherwise, all pods will have container based on the default image. Most of the attributes that make up the Pod are actually assigned to the \"infra\" container. Port bindings, cgroup-parent values, and kernel namespaces are all assigned to the “infra” container. This is critical to understand, because once the pod is created these attributes are assigned to the \"infra\" container and cannot be changed. For example, if you create a pod and then later decide you want to add a container that binds new ports, Podman will not be able to do this. You would need to recreate the pod with the additional port bindings before adding the new container. In the above diagram, notice the box above each container, conmon, this is the container monitor. It is a small C Program that’s job is to watch the primary process of the container, and if the container dies, save the exit code. It also holds open the tty of the container, so that it can be attached to later. This is what allows podman to run in detached mode (backgrounded), so podman can exit but conmon continues to run. Each container has its own instance of conmon. The CLI: podman pod We expose most of the interaction with pods through the podman pod commands. Among other actions, you can use podman pod to create, delete, query, and inspect pods. You can see all the pod related commands by running podman pod without any arguments. $ sudo podman pod NAME: podman pod - Manage container pods. Pods are a group of one or more containers sharing the same network, pid and ipc namespaces. USAGE: podman pod command [command options] [arguments...] COMMANDS: create Create a new empty pod exists Check if a pod exists in local storage inspect displays a pod configuration kill Send the specified signal or SIGKILL to containers in pod pause Pause one or more pods ps, ls, list List pods restart Restart one or more pods rm Remove one or more pods start Start one or more pods stats Display percentage of CPU, memory, network I/O, block I/O and PIDs for containers in one or more pods stop Stop one or more pods top Display the running processes of containers in a pod unpause Unpause one or more pods OPTIONS: --help, -h show help Create a pod The traditional way to create a pod with Podman is using the podman pod create command. $ sudo podman pod create --help NAME: podman pod create - Create a new empty pod USAGE: podman pod create [command options] [arguments...] DESCRIPTION: Creates a new empty pod. The pod ID is then printed to stdout. You can then start it at any time with the podman pod start <pod_id> command. The pod will be created with the initial state 'created'. OPTIONS: --cgroup-parent value Set parent cgroup for the pod --infra Create an infra container associated with the pod to share namespaces with --infra-command value The command to run on the infra container when the pod is started (default: \"/pause\") --infra-image value The image of the infra container to associate with the pod (default: \"k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1\") --label value, -l value Set metadata on pod (default []) --label-file value Read in a line delimited file of labels (default []) --name value, -n value Assign a name to the pod --pod-id-file value Write the pod ID to the file --publish value, -p value Publish a container's port, or a range of ports, to the host (default []) --share value A comma delimited list of kernel namespaces the pod will share (default: \"cgroup,ipc,net,uts\") In its most basic context, you can simply issue podman pod create and Podman will create a pod without extra attributes. A random name will also be assigned to the pod. $ sudo podman pod create 9e0a57248aedc453e7b466d73ef769c99e35d265d97f6fa287442083246f3762 We can list the pods using the podman pod list command: $ sudo podman pod list POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED # OF CONTAINERS INFRA ID 9e0a57248aed youthful_jones Running 5 seconds ago 1 6074ffd22b93 Note that the container has a single container in it. The container is the \"infra\" command. We can further observe this using the podman ps command by passing the command line switch *--pod*. $ sudo podman ps -a --pod CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 6074ffd22b93 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1 3 minutes ago Up 3 minutes ago 9e0a57248aed-infra 9e0a57248aed Here we can see that the pod ID from podman ps matches the pod id in podman pod list. And the container image is the same as the default \"infra\" container image. Add a container to a pod You can add a container to a pod using the *--pod* option in the podman create and podman run commands. For example, here we add a container running **top** to the newly created *youthful_jones* pod. Notice the use of *--pod*. $ sudo podman run -dt --pod youthful_jones docker.io/library/alpine:latest top 0f62e6dcdfdbf3921a7d73353582fa56a545502c89f0dfcb8736ce7be61c9271 And now two containers exist in our pod. $ sudo podman pod ps POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED # OF CONTAINERS INFRA ID 9e0a57248aed youthful_jones Running 7 minutes ago 2 6074ffd22b93 Looking at the list of containers, we also see each container and their respective pod assignment. $ sudo podman ps -a --pod CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 0f62e6dcdfdb docker.io/library/alpine:latest top 14 seconds ago Up 14 seconds ago awesome_archimedes 9e0a57248aed 6074ffd22b93 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1 7 minutes ago Up 7 minutes ago 9e0a57248aed-infra 9e0a57248aed Shortcut to create pods We recently added the ability to create pods via the podman run and podman create commands. One upside to creating a pod with this approach is that the normal port bindings declared for the container will be assigned automatically to the \"infra\" container. However, if you need to specify more granular options for pod creation like kernel namespaces or different \"infra\" container image usage, you still need to create the pod manually as was first described. Nevertheless, for relatively basic pod creations, the shortcut is handy. As this feature was recent added, it isn't available in the version of Podman included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 and 8 Beta. To create a new pod with your new container, you simply pass *--pod*: new:<name>. The use of **new:** indicates to Podman that you want to create a new pod rather than attempt to assign the container to an existing pod. To create a nginx container within a pod and expose port 80 from the container to port 32597 on the host, you would: $ sudo podman run -dt --pod new:nginx -p 32597:80 quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest ac8839fc7dead8e391e7983ad8d0c27ce311d190b0a8eb72dcde535de272d537 $ curl http://localhost:32597 podman rulez And here is what it looks like when listing containers: $ sudo podman ps -ap CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD ac8839fc7dea quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest nginx -g daemon o... 4 minutes ago Up 4 minutes ago happy_cray 3e4cad88f8c2 c2f7c5651275 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1 4 minutes ago Up 4 minutes ago 0.0.0.0:32597->80/tcp 3e4cad88f8c2-infra 3e4cad88f8c2 Pods and container management In Podman, the status of the pod and its containers can be exclusive to each other meaning that containers within pods can be restarted, stopped, and started without impacting the status of the pod. Suppose we have a pod called demodb and it contains two containers (and an “infra” container) running a MariaDB and a nginx session. $ sudo podman pod ps POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED # OF CONTAINERS INFRA ID fa7924a5196c demodb Running About a minute ago 3 3005ed8491d0 $ sudo podman ps -p CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 02e37a3b9873 quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest nginx -g daemon o... 4 minutes ago Up 4 minutes ago optimistic_edison fa7924a5196c 2597454063f8 quay.io/baude/mariadbpoddemo:latest docker-entrypoint... 4 minutes ago Up 4 minutes ago eloquent_golick fa7924a5196c If we wanted to stop and start the nginx container, the status of the MariaDB container and the pod itself will remain unchanged. $ sudo podman stop optimistic_edison 02e37a3b987300e9124b61820119ae425c5e496b907800ecaf1194a3f50e5dcc With the nginx container stopped, we can still observe the demopod is running and the MariaDB container remains unchanged. $ sudo podman pod ps POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED # OF CONTAINERS INFRA ID fa7924a5196c demodb Running 5 minutes ago 3 3005ed8491d0 $ sudo podman ps -p CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 2597454063f8 quay.io/baude/mariadbpoddemo:latest docker-entrypoint... 5 minutes ago Up 5 minutes ago eloquent_golick fa7924a5196c And we can start the nginx container to restore the pod back to its original state. $ sudo podman start optimistic_edison optimistic_edison $ sudo podman ps -p CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 02e37a3b9873 quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest nginx -g daemon o... 8 minutes ago Up 6 seconds ago optimistic_edison fa7924a5196c 2597454063f8 quay.io/baude/mariadbpoddemo:latest docker-entrypoint... 8 minutes ago Up 8 minutes ago eloquent_golick fa7924a5196c We can also stop the pod and all of its containers using the podman pod stop command. $ sudo podman pod stop demodb fa7924a5196cb403298ad2ce24f0db30a3790e80729c7704ef5fdc27302f7ad0 $ sudo podman ps -ap CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES POD 02e37a3b9873 quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest nginx -g daemon o... 10 minutes ago Exited (0) 21 seconds ago optimistic_edison fa7924a5196c 2597454063f8 quay.io/baude/mariadbpoddemo:latest docker-entrypoint... 10 minutes ago Exited (0) 19 seconds ago eloquent_golick fa7924a5196c 3005ed8491d0 k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1 10 minutes ago Exited (0) 19 seconds ago 0.0.0.0:43871->3306/tcp fa7924a5196c-infra fa7924a5196c And if we look at the status of the pod, it will show a state of “Exited”. $ sudo podman pod ps POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED # OF CONTAINERS INFRA ID fa7924a5196c demodb Exited 13 minutes ago 3 3005ed8491d0 Likewise, we can also start the pod and all of its containers back up.

Use Cases of Podman Use Cases of Docker When to use Podman and When to use Docker? Conclusion Podman vs Docker - FAQs What is Container Orchestration? Container orchestration refers to automated process of managing, deploying, scaling, and networking containers within production environment. Containers package software applications with all the necessary dependencies, and orchestration helps coordinate how these containers work together across different hosts.Container orchestration automates the management of container lifecycles, ensuring applications run efficiently and scale to handle traffic spike also quickly recover from failures can handle increased traffic by scaling up and recover quickly from any failures. Popular container orchestration tools include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, which handle tasks such as load balancing, resource allocation, and container health monitoring. What is Podman? Podman is a container management tool used by IT Business organizations to create, manage, and run containers on Linux-based systems. It is a kind of alternative to other container orchestration tools, such as Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Nomad. Podman is mainly a part of the container ecosystem and is designed for developers(users) who prefer a daemon-less and rootless container engine. Features of Podman The following are the features of Podman: Daemonless Architecture: Podman will operate the container process without a central daemon, to enhance the securtiy and reliability. Rootless Containers: It facilitates the users to run the containers without root privileges to reduce the security risks. Comptability: It supports the docker comptabiliity the CLI commands and OCI standards ensuring the seamless transition for docker users. Integrated with systemd: It faciltates to manage the containers as systemd services for better process management. Key Features of Podman The following are the key features of Podman: Container Image Management: Podman can provide the ability to build container images from Dockerfiles or Containerfiles and Developers can manage them effectively. Higher Level of Security: Podman is integrated with high-level security features that help to protect containers and the host system. Daemon-less Architecture & Operation: Podman runs directly as a user-space process without running a daemon. Rootless Containers: Podman supports rootless containers, which can be run by non-privileged users without elevating privileges to root. This feature improves security by limiting attacks and preventing containers from the host system. Pod Support: Pods are lightweight groups where one or more containers can share resources and can be managed as a single unit. Compatibility with Docker: Podman is compatible with Docker. You can use similar Docker and Docker Compose commands to manage Podman containers. What is Docker? Docker is a popular container management tool similar to Podman which is used for developing, testing, and deploying web applications. Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS). It is used for running microservices, which are small, independent applications that can be combined to create a larger application. Docker containers are lightweight and portable so you can run on any operating system platform such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. Docker use operating-system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes docker a secure and efficient way to run applications. Key Features of Docker Improved Productivity: consistent building and testing applications. Faster Deployment: Docker containers can quickly and easily be deployed on any OS platform. Efficient Resource Utilization: Docker containers are lightweight and isolate resources. which can help to improve the utilization of hardware resources. Scalability: With Docker containers developers can be easily scale up or down the resources to meet on-demand project needs. Improves Security: Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes applications more secure by limiting access needs. Who uses Podman and Docker? Podman and Docker are often used by developers, system administrators, and organizations looking for container management solutions that do not rely on a central daemon and provide a higher level of security through rootless operations. Both are helpful in CI/CD pipeline integration with enabling the automated testing, deployment and scaling of applications. Podman vs Docker: A Detailed Comparison In the above topics, we have seen about What is Podman and Docker? Let's understand more in detail with Comparison. Podman and Docker are standalone software packages with their code and dependencies. These two services are widely used in IT technology because they are lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability in any environment. They also allows developers to package software quickly and efficiently at scale. If you are working with Podman or Docker, you must understand the main difference, which is their model architecture. Generally, Docker uses a daemon-based architecture, whereas Podman doesn't have a daemon-based architecture as it works with a daemon-less architecture. Podman and Docker are compatible with any environment, as they support features to separate the software from the operating system. This kind of separation helps business organizations to control bugs, errors, and various challenges that arise during development or in different phases of the environment. Here in the table, you can find the detailed comparison between Podman and Docker: Feature Comparison Podman Docker Architecture Podman uses a Daemon-less Architecture. Docker uses a Daemon-based Architecture. Portability Podman is can work with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Docker will also with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Compatibility If you have existing Docker and planning to Switch to Podman. Use can easily switch to Podman as it is compatible with Docker commands and Docker Compose. Docker or Docker Compose are not compatible with Podman commands or Podman Compose. But's it's not a issue at all as Podman works with docker commands. Security Podman is more secure when compared with Docker as it uses daemon-less architecture. Docker is less secure when compared with Podman as it uses daemon-based architecture. Here the resources utilization would be high and less secure. Lightweight/Less Resource Usage Podman is very lightweight than docker due it's daemon-less architecture model. It use very less resources at host machine which make deployment faster and easier for developers. Docker is also lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability but Podman takes the lead as it is more lightweight and porable on any operating-system.

Anjali Udasi Share: When it comes to containerization technologies, Podman and Docker are the two giants that often come up in conversation. Both have revolutionized how we build, deploy, and manage containers, but what sets them apart? In this blog, we'll dive deep into a side-by-side comparison of Podman and Docker. We'll cover everything from architecture to security, performance, and compatibility. What is Docker? Docker has been the go-to containerization platform for developers since its inception in 2013. It's widely used to package applications and their dependencies into containers that can run consistently across different environments. Docker consists of several components, including the Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Hub, and more. Key Features of Docker: Containerization Platform: Docker allows you to package applications in isolated containers. Docker Hub: A popular repository for pre-built images that can be pulled and used for development. Widely Adopted: Docker is the industry standard, and many cloud providers support it. 📖 For more insights on maintaining system performance, check out our blog on server monitoring tools and their role in observability. What is Podman? Podman is a newer tool that aims to provide an alternative to Docker while retaining compatibility with Docker's features. Developed by Red Hat, Podman is designed to be a daemonless container engine, which means it doesn't rely on a central daemon like Docker does. This makes it particularly attractive for certain use cases, such as rootless containers, which don't require elevated privileges to run. Key Features of Podman: Daemonless Architecture: Podman runs without a central daemon, which can lead to more flexibility in certain environments. Rootless Containers: Podman allows users to run containers as non-root users, enhancing security. Docker Compatibility: Podman aims to be a drop-in replacement for Docker, meaning it can often use the same commands and workflows. Podman vs Docker: A Quick Comparison Feature Podman Docker Architecture Daemonless; no central background service required. Requires a central Docker daemon to manage containers and images. Rootless Mode Supports running containers without root privileges. Requires root access unless explicitly configured for rootless mode. Command Compatibility Docker-compatible CLI; most Docker commands work seamlessly. Standard Docker CLI commands. File for Building Images Uses Podmanfile (but fully compatible with Dockerfile). Uses Dockerfile. Image Registries Supports Docker Hub, private registries, and other container registries. Primarily integrates with Docker Hub but supports private registries. Compose Tool Podman Compose (not as widely used or tested). Docker Compose (industry standard). Systemd Integration Directly generates systemd unit files for container management. No native systemd integration; requires third-party tools/scripts. Tooling Support Works with many Docker tools but lacks support for Docker-specific features like Docker Swarm and Docker Desktop. Full ecosystem support, including Docker Desktop and Docker Swarm. Security More secure with rootless containers and no daemon running as root. Relies on root privileges for daemon; higher attack surface. Performance Lightweight due to daemonless architecture. Performance depends on daemon's resource usage. Adoption Growing adoption, especially in security-conscious environments. Widely adopted as the industry standard. Architecture The most notable difference between Podman and Docker is their architecture. Docker uses a client-server model, where the Docker CLI communicates with a Docker daemon running as a background process. This daemon is responsible for managing containers and images. Podman, on the other hand, follows a daemonless architecture, which means there's no central daemon. Instead, each Podman command runs in its own process. This architecture allows for more flexibility and better security in certain situations. Pros of Docker's Architecture: Centralized management of containers. Easier to scale in large environments. Pros of Podman’s Architecture: More secure due to its rootless container capability. More lightweight and modular. Security Security is a critical concern when dealing with containerized applications, and both Docker and Podman offer robust security features. However, Podman takes security a step further with its ability to run containers as a non-root user. This eliminates the need for elevated privileges, reducing the attack surface. With Docker, you typically need to run containers with root privileges, which can be a security risk if an attacker compromises a container. Podman Security: Supports rootless containers, which limits the potential damage from security breaches. Uses SELinux and AppArmor profiles for container isolation. Docker Security: Runs containers with elevated privileges by default, making them potentially more vulnerable. Docker’s security model can be improved with tools like Docker Content Trust, but it requires additional configuration. 📖 To understand how Datadog and Grafana stack up, explore our detailed comparison in the blog Datadog vs. Grafana. Compatibility One of the reasons Podman has gained traction is its Docker compatibility. Podman commands are designed to be a drop-in replacement for Docker, meaning if you're familiar with Docker's CLI, you'll feel right at home with Podman. For example: docker run becomes podman run docker build becomes podman build docker ps becomes podman ps This compatibility allows for a smoother transition for teams looking to migrate from Docker to Podman without changing their workflows. Docker Compatibility: Docker has widespread support across cloud providers, CI/CD pipelines, and orchestration tools. Podman Compatibility: Podman offers full compatibility with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose, making it easy for developers to switch without changing their workflows. Performance Both Docker and Podman offer similar performance when it comes to running containers. However, due to Podman’s daemonless architecture, it can be more lightweight and may offer faster startup times in some cases. Podman’s process-based model means that it doesn’t need to keep a long-running background service, which can lead to a more responsive user experience. In contrast, Docker's daemon can sometimes introduce overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage. 📝 Looking for Heroku alternatives? Check out our blog on the Best Heroku Alternatives. Docker Performance: Docker can be more efficient in large-scale environments due to its long-running daemon. Optimized for distributed systems. Podman Performance: Podman can offer faster start times due to its daemonless nature. More lightweight for smaller-scale or isolated environments. Ecosystem and Tooling Docker has a robust ecosystem built over the years, including tools like Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and Docker Swarm for orchestration. Docker also integrates with popular orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Podman, while still developing its ecosystem, is fully compatible with Kubernetes and can be used as a container runtime in Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, Podman supports Podman Compose, a tool that mimics Docker Compose for defining multi-container applications. Docker Ecosystem: Wide adoption and established tooling like Docker Compose and Docker Swarm. Strong support in CI/CD pipelines and cloud providers. Podman Ecosystem: Growing ecosystem with compatibility for Docker Compose and Kubernetes. More community-driven with a focus on security and flexibility. 📝 Discover the top Linux monitoring tools in our blog on The Best Linux Monitoring Tools for 2024. Ease of Use Docker has a well-established reputation for being easy to use, with a simple and intuitive CLI. Its tooling is mature, and its documentation is extensive. Podman, while generally user-friendly, can have a bit of a learning curve due to its daemonless and rootless architecture. However, it provides a familiar CLI for those already accustomed to Docker. Docker Ease of Use: Mature, well-documented, and widely adopted. Simple for developers to get started with containerization. Podman Ease of Use: Easier for users who need rootless containers and more security features. Slight learning curve for Docker users, but minimal due to command compatibility. When to Use Podman vs Docker Use Docker if: You’re already heavily invested in the Docker ecosystem. You need mature orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or integration with cloud providers. You prioritize ease of use and a large, well-established community. Use Podman if: You need rootless containers for enhanced security. You prefer a daemonless, modular architecture. You want to explore an alternative to Docker without abandoning your existing Docker workflow (since Podman is compatible with Docker commands). 📖 Explore the latest innovations with our guide on Top 10 Platform Engineering Tools in 2024. Container Orchestration When it comes to managing multiple containers, orchestration is a crucial aspect. Both Docker and Podman offer ways to handle complex container deployments, but their approaches and tools for orchestration differ. Let’s explore how each handles this critical aspect of container management. Docker's Approach to Orchestration Docker has long been known for its integration with Docker Swarm, a native orchestration tool designed to manage a cluster of Docker engines. Docker Swarm enables you to deploy and scale containers across multiple machines with ease. It offers features like load balancing, automatic service discovery, and self-healing to ensure that your application containers run smoothly, even in large-scale, distributed environments. Key Docker Orchestration Tools: Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a powerful tool that helps you define and run multi-container applications. With a simple YAML file, developers can specify multiple services (containers), networks, and volumes. It’s ideal for local development, testing, and smaller-scale containerized applications. Docker Compose allows you to run all your containers with a single command, making multi-container management straightforward. Docker Swarm: Docker Swarm is Docker’s own native container orchestration tool. It allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes and containers, automatically distributing containers across the cluster for high availability and scalability. Swarm makes it easy to deploy, scale, and manage services in production environments. 📝 Understand the differences and pick the right orchestration tool with our guide on Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm. Kubernetes Integration: Docker also integrates well with Kubernetes, the most widely used container orchestration system for larger-scale, cloud-native environments. While Kubernetes is not a Docker-native tool, Docker containers are often used as the container runtime within Kubernetes clusters. Docker's orchestration tools are highly popular due to their ease of use, scalability, and tight integration with the Docker ecosystem. Docker Compose is especially helpful for smaller-scale, local development, while Docker Swarm and Kubernetes provide more robust options for managing containers at scale. Podman’s Approach to Orchestration Podman, being a newer tool, initially did not have native orchestration capabilities. However, its design has evolved to include compatibility with orchestration tools, making it a serious contender for managing containers in both development and production environments. Key Podman Orchestration Tools: Podman Compose: Podman offers Podman Compose, a tool that mimics Docker Compose. It allows you to define multi-container applications using a YAML file, similar to Docker Compose. Podman Compose is perfect for users transitioning from Docker to Podman, as it provides the same functionality for defining and running multi-container applications. This makes it simple for developers to manage containerized applications with ease. Kubernetes Integration: Just like Docker, Podman also integrates with Kubernetes. In fact, Podman can generate Kubernetes YAML files from existing container configurations, which makes it easy to use Podman containers as part of a Kubernetes-based orchestration setup. However, unlike Docker, which requires the Docker daemon to run in Kubernetes clusters, Podman can run in a rootless mode, providing added security and flexibility. 📖 Explore tips for managing container logs effectively in our guide on Docker Compose Logs. Systemd Integration: Podman can also be integrated with systemd, a system and service manager for Linux-based systems. Podman’s ability to work with systemd makes it easy to manage containers as system services, allowing you to handle container lifecycles and orchestration directly through systemd’s native service management tools. This is especially useful for containerized applications on Linux servers that need to be managed as part of the system’s service architecture. Rootless Containers: Podman’s unique architecture allows for rootless container orchestration, meaning users can manage containers without requiring root privileges. This is a significant advantage for environments where security and least privilege are important, as containers can be deployed and managed by non-privileged users. This rootless capability makes Podman an attractive choice for smaller teams or developers who prioritize security. When to Use Each Tool for Orchestration Use Docker if: You require robust orchestration features like Docker Swarm or integration with Kubernetes for large-scale deployments. You need a mature ecosystem and tools for multi-node cluster management. You're already familiar with Docker's workflow and ecosystem, and prefer the simplicity of managing containers with a central daemon. Use Podman if: You need to run containers without requiring a central daemon and prefer a daemonless architecture. You want to manage rootless containers for added security, especially in environments where security is a top concern. You are looking for an alternative to Docker Compose with Podman Compose, or need to integrate containers with systemd for service management. Key Differences in Orchestration Between Podman and Docker Daemon vs. Daemonless One of the most significant differences is Podman’s daemonless architecture. This means that it doesn't require a central service to manage containers. This makes Podman more flexible, particularly in situations where running a central daemon may not be ideal. In contrast, Docker relies on the Docker daemon, which is necessary for managing container orchestration. For developers and organizations looking for a simpler, more secure approach, Podman’s daemonless setup can be a key advantage. Rootless vs. Rooted Containers While Docker typically runs containers as the root user, Podman allows for rootless containers. This enhances security, especially in multi-tenant environments or on shared systems. Rootless containers also provide an easier approach to orchestrating containers with less risk of privilege escalation. 📖 Learn how to integrate Grafana with Docker in our detailed guide on Grafana and Docker. Cluster Management Docker Swarm is a comprehensive solution for cluster management. With Docker Swarm, you can deploy containers across multiple nodes, scale applications, and handle fault tolerance. Podman, being daemonless, doesn’t have an internal orchestration tool like Swarm. Instead, Podman relies on Kubernetes or systemd for larger-scale orchestration. Container Networking Docker provides robust networking capabilities, including support for bridge networks, host networks, and overlay networks in Docker Swarm. Podman also offers container networking features, but these are generally more focused on local or rootless containers. For full-scale networking and multi-node orchestration, both tools integrate well with Kubernetes. Building and Managing Container Images One of the key tasks when working with containers is the ability to build and manage container images. Both Podman and Docker offer tools to create, push, and pull images, but there are some key differences in how each tool operates and integrates with image registries. Docker’s Approach to Building and Managing Images Docker is synonymous with container image building. It's a powerful tool that allows you to easily create, manage, and distribute container images, with a well-established workflow that has become the industry standard. Building Docker Images: Dockerfile: Docker uses the Dockerfile to define the steps for building an image. This text file specifies a series of commands (like FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD) to assemble the image from a base image. Once the Dockerfile is written, the docker build command is used to create the container image. Docker Build Context: The build context refers to the files and directories that are available for the image build process. When running the docker build, Docker sends the context to the Docker daemon, which uses it to create the image. Image Layers: Docker images are built in layers, meaning each command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. These layers are cached, making the build process faster for subsequent builds if nothing has changed. 📖 Discover the top Docker alternatives in our blog post on Top 10 Docker Alternatives. Managing Docker Images Image Registries: Docker images are typically stored and shared through image registries. The most popular registry is Docker Hub, a public registry that hosts a vast number of official and community-contributed container images. Users can push images to Docker Hub using docker push and pull images using docker pull. Private Registries: Docker also supports private registries for teams and organizations that require more control over their images. This allows you to store images securely within your own infrastructure or cloud service. Tagging and Versioning: Docker images are tagged with a version, which makes it easy to manage multiple versions of the same image. Tags are typically used for different versions (e.g., myapp:v1.0 and myapp:v1.1), allowing you to reference the correct version when running containers. Tools for Managing Docker Images: Docker CLI: The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is the most commonly used tool for interacting with Docker images. You use commands like docker build, docker push, docker pull, docker images, and docker rmi to build, manage, and delete images. Docker Desktop: For developers who prefer a graphical user interface, Docker Desktop provides an intuitive UI to manage Docker images, containers, and networks without relying on the command line. Docker’s image-building and management features are highly robust, and its integration with Docker Hub makes it easy to share and access container images globally. Podman’s Approach to Building and Managing Images Podman shares many similarities with Docker when it comes to building and managing container images. Podman was designed to be Docker-compatible, so users familiar with Docker can transition smoothly. Building Podman Images: Podmanfile: Like Docker, Podman uses a Podmanfile (similar to a Dockerfile) to define the steps for building an image. This file works in the same way as a Dockerfile, with commands such as FROM, RUN, COPY, and CMD used to construct the image. Build Context: Podman also uses a build context similar to Docker. You specify the files and directories needed for the build, and the build context is passed along to Podman to create the image. Image Layers: Just like Docker, Podman images are built in layers, with each command in the Podmanfile creating a separate layer. Podman also supports image layer caching to speed up subsequent builds. 📝 Learn how to manage container restarts with Docker Compose in our blog on Docker Compose Restart. Managing Podman Images: Image Registries: Podman can interact with Docker Hub and other container image registries just like Docker. It supports pulling and pushing images using the standard docker:// or podman:// protocols. This means you can pull images from Docker Hub or push images to private registries without any compatibility issues. Private Registries: Podman allows you to push and pull images from both public and private registries. Users can authenticate to registries using podman login, ensuring secure access to private images. Tagging and Versioning: Podman supports tagging images the same way Docker does. This makes it easy to version your images, whether you're working with a local build or a shared image in a registry. Tools for Managing Podman Images: Podman CLI: The Podman Command Line Interface (CLI) is very similar to Docker’s CLI, and many Docker commands (such as podman build, podman pull, podman push, podman images, podman rmi) are functionally equivalent to their Docker counterparts. Podman Desktop: For users who prefer a GUI, Podman Desktop is a graphical tool that provides an easy-to-use interface to manage containers, images, and other container resources on your machine. Podman in Rootless Mode: One unique feature of Podman is its ability to run in rootless mode, meaning you don’t need elevated privileges to build or manage container images. This is a security feature that allows individual users to create and manage containers without requiring root access. Key Differences in Image Building and Management Daemon vs. Daemonless: Docker relies on a central Docker daemon to manage containers and images, meaning all image-building and management operations are handled by this background service. Podman, on the other hand, operates daemonless, meaning it doesn’t require a central service to manage containers and images. This can result in improved security and less system resource consumption when using Podman. Rootless Containers: Podman’s ability to run in rootless mode allows users to build and manage images without needing root privileges, making it a more secure choice in environments where security is a priority. Docker, however, requires root access to manage containers and images unless configured differently. Dockerfile vs. Podmanfile: While the Dockerfile is the default for Docker, Podman uses a Podmanfile to build images, which is functionally the same but with a different name. This means that a Dockerfile is fully compatible with Podman without any changes, and vice versa. Tooling Compatibility: Since Podman was designed to be Docker-compatible, most Docker-related tools, like Docker Compose, work seamlessly with Podman (through Podman Compose). This allows you to transition from Docker to Podman with minimal friction while retaining the same set of tools for building and managing images. Transitioning from Docker to Podman: Process, Ease, and Resources For many developers and organizations accustomed to Docker, transitioning to Podman can be an appealing move due to its unique benefits like daemonless operation and rootless containers. But how easy is it to make the switch? Let's break down the transition process, covering key steps, challenges, and resources to make the move smoother. 📖 For a comprehensive guide on how to tail Docker logs, check out our blog on Docker Logs Tail. Why Transition to Podman? Before we talk about the transition process, let’s quickly look at why some users are considering Podman as an alternative to Docker: Daemonless Architecture: Podman runs without a central daemon, meaning there’s no background service running with elevated privileges. This offers enhanced security, particularly for environments that prioritize rootless operations. Rootless Containers: Podman allows users to run containers without needing root access, which reduces the risk of container-related security vulnerabilities. Docker-Compatible Commands: Podman was designed with Docker compatibility in mind. Many of the Docker CLI commands are directly supported by Podman, making the transition much easier. If these benefits align with your goals, the good news is that transitioning from Docker to Podman is relatively simple. Let’s look at how you can make the move and what to expect along the way. The Transition Process: Docker to Podman 1. Install Podman The first step is installing Podman on your system. Podman is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and installation is straightforward. On most Linux distributions, you can install Podman directly from the system's package manager (e.g., apt, dnf, brew On macOS). Installation guides are available on the official Podman website, and the process is well-documented for all major platforms. 2. Replace Docker Commands with Podman The main reason transitioning to Podman is easy is its Docker compatibility. Most Docker commands can be directly replaced with their Podman equivalents. For example: docker build becomes podman build docker pull becomes podman pull docker push becomes podman push docker run becomes podman run docker ps becomes podman ps docker stop becomes podman stop If you're familiar with Docker, using Podman will feel almost identical, allowing for a smooth transition. 3. Managing Containers Without Docker Daemon One of the major differences between Docker and Podman is that Podman operates daemonless. Docker relies on a central daemon that manages containers, but Podman doesn’t require a background service running, which simplifies its architecture. As a result, Podman commands are executed in a more lightweight manner, and containers are managed per user session without the need for administrative privileges. This can be especially useful in environments where security is a concern. 4. Managing Images Images are managed similarly in both Docker and Podman. You can pull, build, tag, and push container images using the same commands. If you’ve already been using Docker Hub, you can continue to pull from and push images to Docker Hub using Podman without any changes. Podman also supports private registries and can work with registries like Quay, GitHub Container Registry, or even your self-hosted solutions. 5. Podman Compose For Docker Compose users, the good news is that Podman Compose allows you to use Compose files with Podman. While Docker Compose is widely used to manage multi-container applications, Podman has an equivalent tool, which allows users to orchestrate multiple containers with YAML configuration files in the same way Docker Compose does. Podman Compose works similarly to Docker Compose, so if you’ve already written docker-compose.yml files for your project, you can use them directly with Podman Compose. 📖 For a detailed step-by-step guide on Docker monitoring with Prometheus, visit our blog on Docker Monitoring with Prometheus. 6. Systemd Integration One of Podman’s standout features is its systemd integration. Podman can generate systemd unit files that allow users to run containers as system services. This means you can run your containers with the same management features you would use for a regular service on Linux. This is especially useful for automating container deployment and management, and it can simplify operations for users who prefer to work with systemd. Challenges to Watch Out For Although transitioning from Docker to Podman is generally smooth, there are a few things to keep in mind: Missing Features: While Podman supports many Docker features, it doesn't yet have full compatibility with Docker Compose in all scenarios. For complex docker-compose.yml files, you might need to adjust some configurations to ensure compatibility. Tooling: Although Podman works well with many Docker tools, some Docker-specific tooling (like Docker Desktop or Docker Swarm) may not be supported directly by Podman. However, for most container management tasks, Podman provides adequate support. Learning Curve for Rootless Containers: While running containers without root privileges is a great security feature, it can introduce a learning curve, especially if you’re new to running containers in rootless mode. Understanding how this impacts file permissions, networking, and container volumes can require some experimentation. Podman Compose Compatibility: While Podman Compose is an excellent tool, it’s not as widely used or tested as Docker Compose. Depending on the complexity of your containerized applications, you might need to tweak some of your docker-compose.yml files for compatibility. 📖 For a comprehensive guide on installing OpenTelemetry Collector, check out our Developer's Guide to Installing OpenTelemetry Collector. Conclusion So, which one should you choose — Podman or Docker? It ultimately depends on your needs and the environment in which you're working. Docker remains the industry standard with a broad ecosystem and great ease of use, while Podman offers an exciting alternative with enhanced security features and a more flexible, daemonless architecture. Both tools excel at containerization, so if you’re deciding between the two, consider factors like security, ecosystem compatibility, and performance requirements. 🤝 If you still want to discuss anything, our community on Discord is open!

Higher Level of Security: Podman is integrated with high-level security features that help to protect containers and the host system. Daemon-less Architecture & Operation: Podman runs directly as a user-space process without running a daemon. Rootless Containers: Podman supports rootless containers, which can be run by non-privileged users without elevating privileges to root. This feature improves security by limiting attacks and preventing containers from the host system. Pod Support: Pods are lightweight groups where one or more containers can share resources and can be managed as a single unit. Compatibility with Docker: Podman is compatible with Docker. You can use similar Docker and Docker Compose commands to manage Podman containers. What is Docker? Docker is a popular container management tool similar to Podman which is used for developing, testing, and deploying web applications. Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS). It is used for running microservices, which are small, independent applications that can be combined to create a larger application. Docker containers are lightweight and portable so you can run on any operating system platform such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. Docker use operating-system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes docker a secure and efficient way to run applications. Key Features of Docker Improved Productivity: consistent building and testing applications. Faster Deployment: Docker containers can quickly and easily be deployed on any OS platform. Efficient Resource Utilization: Docker containers are lightweight and isolate resources. which can help to improve the utilization of hardware resources. Scalability: With Docker containers developers can be easily scale up or down the resources to meet on-demand project needs. Improves Security: Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes applications more secure by limiting access needs. Who uses Podman and Docker? Podman and Docker are often used by developers, system administrators, and organizations looking for container management solutions that do not rely on a central daemon and provide a higher level of security through rootless operations. Both are helpful in CI/CD pipeline integration with enabling the automated testing, deployment and scaling of applications. Podman vs Docker: A Detailed Comparison In the above topics, we have seen about What is Podman and Docker? Let's understand more in detail with Comparison. Podman and Docker are standalone software packages with their code and dependencies. These two services are widely used in IT technology because they are lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability in any environment. They also allows developers to package software quickly and efficiently at scale. If you are working with Podman or Docker, you must understand the main difference, which is their model architecture. Generally, Docker uses a daemon-based architecture, whereas Podman doesn't have a daemon-based architecture as it works with a daemon-less architecture. Podman and Docker are compatible with any environment, as they support features to separate the software from the operating system. This kind of separation helps business organizations to control bugs, errors, and various challenges that arise during development or in different phases of the environment. Here in the table, you can find the detailed comparison between Podman and Docker: Feature Comparison Podman Docker Architecture Podman uses a Daemon-less Architecture. Docker uses a Daemon-based Architecture. Portability Podman is can work with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Docker will also with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Compatibility If you have existing Docker and planning to Switch to Podman. Use can easily switch to Podman as it is compatible with Docker commands and Docker Compose. Docker or Docker Compose are not compatible with Podman commands or Podman Compose. But's it's not a issue at all as Podman works with docker commands. Security Podman is more secure when compared with Docker as it uses daemon-less architecture. Docker is less secure when compared with Podman as it uses daemon-based architecture.

However, as containerization became the norm in DevOps, competitors like Podman emerged as viable alternatives. This article will compare two container management engines - Docker and Podman. It will also help you choose the right engine for your needs. Note: Learn more about the differences between containers and VMs. What Is Docker? Docker is a popular platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers. Docker containers allow developers to apply a system-agnostic approach to software deployment. Since Docker runs the same containers on any operating system, containerized applications are cross-platform. What Is Podman? Podman is an open-source, daemonless, rootless container engine developed by RedHat and designed as an alternative to Docker. The modular design allows Podman to use individual system components only when needed. Its rootless approach to container management allows containers to be run by non-root users. Podman vs. Docker: Comparison In the following section, the article will go in-depth into the similarities and differences between Podman and Docker. Docker Podman Daemon Uses the Docker daemon. Daemonless architecture. Root Runs containers as root-only. Runs containers as root and as non-root. Images Can build container images. Uses Buildah to build container images. Architecture Client-server. Fork-exec. All-in-one platform Yes. No. Docker-swarm Supported. Not supported. Docker-compose Supported. Supported. SELinux support Via a module. Native. Firewall interaction Overrides firewall rules. Does not override the firewall. Runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL). Note: If you need Podman installed, refer to our installation guides on How to Install Podman on macOS and How to Install Podman on Ubuntu. Architecture Docker utilizes client-server architecture. The Docker daemon is a persistent background process that manages containers and maintains communication between the client and the server. The docker version command output shows separate sections for the client and the server versions: Another noteworthy feature of Docker is its all-in-one approach to container management. Docker provides all the necessary components for creating and running containers through its core application and integrated tools. Podman manages containers using the fork-exec model. Since Podman is a process and does not use the client-server paradigm, it does not require a daemon to run. Podman containers are child processes of the primary Podman process. Using the podman version command shows that Podman lists only one version number: The central unit of Podman architecture is a container. However, Podman also introduces the pod concept. Like Kubernetes pods, Podman pods are groups of one or more containers that share the same system resources. The pod comprises the main container and sidecar (infra) containers supporting it. Unlike Docker, which attempts to provide a single solution to containerization, Podman has been designed to run containers. Users perform the rest of the container management operations by extending Podman's functionality with additional tools such as: Buildah for image creation. Skopeo for image distribution and image repository manipulation. Nomad for scheduling and orchestration. Note: Find out how Nomad compares to Kubernetes. Ease of Use Docker features a comprehensive set of intuitive commands. With Docker, developers can easily create, deploy, and manage containerized applications. Podman was built to replace Docker in a software development workflow seamlessly, so its commands are mostly the same as Docker's. For example, the docker pull command becomes podman pull: Aside from Podman inheriting the ease of use of Docker, the similarity between the two tools also means that the migration from Docker to Podman requires little effort. Daemon Usage and Root Privileges Docker features a background daemon process called dockerd. The daemon receives commands via Docker CLI and handles all the container management operations. The Docker's architecture requires the daemon to run as the root user, so the users need root privileges to interact with it. Podman does not feature a central daemon process. Instead, Podman commands run as separate processes that do not require superuser privileges. Rootless Execution Users who are not in the docker UNIX group must run Docker commands using the sudo command. Running Docker in rootless mode is possible but requires installing additional packages and specific storage drivers. Podman is rootless by design. Thanks to its modular architecture, granting different privileges to different users is possible. Building Images Docker uses the docker build command to build container images from a Dockerfile and a build context. The build context is a set of files specified in the Dockerfile used in container creation. Podman features the podman build command that uses a syntax similar to docker build. However, Podman performs the building process using Buildah, another open-source tool. When podman build is executed, the buildah bud (build-using-dockerfile) command is called to emulate the docker build command. External Support Both Docker and Podman can expand functionality with external tools. The sections below present some of those tools and compare how Docker and Podman interact with them. Docker Swarm Docker Swarm is a container orchestration platform for managing Docker containers. It enables developers to run a cluster of Docker nodes and deploy a scalable application without other dependencies required. Podman does not support Docker Swarm. However, Podman users can use Nomad, which comes with a Podman driver. Note: To read more about Docker Swarm and compare it to Kubernetes, read Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes. Docker Compose Docker Compose is Docker's tool for managing multi-container application environments. It automates container initiation and management and streamlines the software development life cycle (SDLC). Previous versions of Podman did not have a way to simulate the Docker daemon necessary for Docker Compose to work, so they used less user-friendly alternatives like Podman Compose. However, as of version 3.0, Podman supports Docker Compose via podman.socket, a UNIX socket that replaces the Docker daemon. SELinux SELinux is a framework that provides an extra layer of security to Linux systems, built as an extension of Access Control Lists (ACLs). Docker has an SELinux module, but Podman's implementation is native and more user-friendly. On an SELinux-enabled OS, each container run by Podman has a SELinux label that prevents external processes from accessing the container's files. Security Docker is a secure tool, although some aspects of its design need attention from a security standpoint. Take the following into consideration when using Docker: Running containers in privileged mode is not recommended. Docker is secure only when the containers are run in the default, non-privileged mode. Docker can interfere with firewall rules. Iptables rules inserted by Docker are placed before firewall rules, effectively ignoring the firewall. Unless properly addressed, this behavior can cause serious security issues. Note: Docker's security can be increased further by enabling AppArmor, SELinux, and GRSEC, and applying security best practices. Podman's fork-exec architecture makes it a more secure solution than Docker. Below are some of the ways in which Podman provides more security: More in-depth audit logging. Podman's fork-exec model lets the system record the user modifying the system files correctly. However, the client-server approach that Docker uses does not provide this feature. Rootless containers. Assigning specific privileges to specific users gives administrators better access control for critical server components. No interference with firewall rules. Podman enables container networking by creating an internal network whose rules cannot override external firewall rules. Note: OCI containers hosted on Bare Metal Cloud offer better performance and efficiency than those hosted on cloud VMs. Podman vs. Docker: How to Choose Choose Docker if you: Prefer a well-documented tool. Docker's main advantage over Podman is its widespread use. A large amount of Docker-related support means that searching the internet can resolve many potential issues. Require container orchestration support. Docker Swarm support is another benefit of Docker. Users who want to orchestrate Podman containers must resort to less feature-rich alternatives than Docker Swarm or dive into Kubernetes. While popular, Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and may be too complex for simple projects. Choose Podman if you: Emphasize security. Podman's architecture is inherently more secure than Docker's. Plan to move to Kubernetes down the road. Podman introduces the pod concept, which makes it a good starting point for Kubernetes. Use systemd. One of the main benefits of Podman compared to Docker is that Podman fully integrates with systemd by default. This feature enables Podman to run systemd within the container out of the box. Podman vs. Docker: FAQ Since Podman and Docker have similar functionality and cater to the same use cases, deciding which one to use can be problematic. Below, you can find some of the most commonly asked questions concerning the comparison between Podman and Docker. Can Podman Replace Docker? Podman alone does not fully match Docker in features. However, using Podman alongside its companion tools (Buildah, Skopeo, Nomad, etc.) can fully replace Docker. Is Podman More Secure than Docker? Yes, Podman is rootless by design, which makes it a more secure solution. Its daemonless design removes the single point of failure created by Docker's central daemon. Is Podman Compatible with Docker? Since both Docker and Podman are OCI-compliant, they can be used side-by-side. For example, Docker's robustness can be employed on development machines, while dev, int, and prod environments can benefit from Podman's increased security. Can Docker Images Be Used with Podman? Yes, Podman can run containers with images created in Docker and vice versa. The two platforms support the same image format.

They also allows developers to package software quickly and efficiently at scale. If you are working with Podman or Docker, you must understand the main difference, which is their model architecture. Generally, Docker uses a daemon-based architecture, whereas Podman doesn't have a daemon-based architecture as it works with a daemon-less architecture. Podman and Docker are compatible with any environment, as they support features to separate the software from the operating system. This kind of separation helps business organizations to control bugs, errors, and various challenges that arise during development or in different phases of the environment. Here in the table, you can find the detailed comparison between Podman and Docker: Feature Comparison Podman Docker Architecture Podman uses a Daemon-less Architecture. Docker uses a Daemon-based Architecture. Portability Podman is can work with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Docker will also with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Compatibility If you have existing Docker and planning to Switch to Podman. Use can easily switch to Podman as it is compatible with Docker commands and Docker Compose. Docker or Docker Compose are not compatible with Podman commands or Podman Compose. But's it's not a issue at all as Podman works with docker commands. Security Podman is more secure when compared with Docker as it uses daemon-less architecture. Docker is less secure when compared with Podman as it uses daemon-based architecture. Here the resources utilization would be high and less secure. Lightweight/Less Resource Usage Podman is very lightweight than docker due it's daemon-less architecture model. It use very less resources at host machine which make deployment faster and easier for developers. Docker is also lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability but Podman takes the lead as it is more lightweight and porable on any operating-system.

However, as containerization became the norm in DevOps, competitors like Podman emerged as viable alternatives. This article will compare two container management engines - Docker and Podman. It will also help you choose the right engine for your needs. Note: Learn more about the differences between containers and VMs. What Is Docker? Docker is a popular platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers. Docker containers allow developers to apply a system-agnostic approach to software deployment. Since Docker runs the same containers on any operating system, containerized applications are cross-platform. What Is Podman? Podman is an open-source, daemonless, rootless container engine developed by RedHat and designed as an alternative to Docker. The modular design allows Podman to use individual system components only when needed. Its rootless approach to container management allows containers to be run by non-root users. Podman vs. Docker: Comparison In the following section, the article will go in-depth into the similarities and differences between Podman and Docker. Docker Podman Daemon Uses the Docker daemon. Daemonless architecture. Root Runs containers as root-only. Runs containers as root and as non-root. Images Can build container images. Uses Buildah to build container images. Architecture Client-server. Fork-exec. All-in-one platform Yes. No. Docker-swarm Supported. Not supported. Docker-compose Supported. Supported. SELinux support Via a module. Native. Firewall interaction Overrides firewall rules. Does not override the firewall. Runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL). Note: If you need Podman installed, refer to our installation guides on How to Install Podman on macOS and How to Install Podman on Ubuntu. Architecture Docker utilizes client-server architecture. The Docker daemon is a persistent background process that manages containers and maintains communication between the client and the server. The docker version command output shows separate sections for the client and the server versions: Another noteworthy feature of Docker is its all-in-one approach to container management. Docker provides all the necessary components for creating and running containers through its core application and integrated tools. Podman manages containers using the fork-exec model. Since Podman is a process and does not use the client-server paradigm, it does not require a daemon to run. Podman containers are child processes of the primary Podman process. Using the podman version command shows that Podman lists only one version number: The central unit of Podman architecture is a container. However, Podman also introduces the pod concept. Like Kubernetes pods, Podman pods are groups of one or more containers that share the same system resources. The pod comprises the main container and sidecar (infra) containers supporting it. Unlike Docker, which attempts to provide a single solution to containerization, Podman has been designed to run containers. Users perform the rest of the container management operations by extending Podman's functionality with additional tools such as: Buildah for image creation. Skopeo for image distribution and image repository manipulation. Nomad for scheduling and orchestration. Note: Find out how Nomad compares to Kubernetes. Ease of Use Docker features a comprehensive set of intuitive commands. With Docker, developers can easily create, deploy, and manage containerized applications. Podman was built to replace Docker in a software development workflow seamlessly, so its commands are mostly the same as Docker's. For example, the docker pull command becomes podman pull: Aside from Podman inheriting the ease of use of Docker, the similarity between the two tools also means that the migration from Docker to Podman requires little effort. Daemon Usage and Root Privileges Docker features a background daemon process called dockerd. The daemon receives commands via Docker CLI and handles all the container management operations. The Docker's architecture requires the daemon to run as the root user, so the users need root privileges to interact with it. Podman does not feature a central daemon process. Instead, Podman commands run as separate processes that do not require superuser privileges. Rootless Execution Users who are not in the docker UNIX group must run Docker commands using the sudo command. Running Docker in rootless mode is possible but requires installing additional packages and specific storage drivers. Podman is rootless by design. Thanks to its modular architecture, granting different privileges to different users is possible. Building Images Docker uses the docker build command to build container images from a Dockerfile and a build context. The build context is a set of files specified in the Dockerfile used in container creation. Podman features the podman build command that uses a syntax similar to docker build. However, Podman performs the building process using Buildah, another open-source tool. When podman build is executed, the buildah bud (build-using-dockerfile) command is called to emulate the docker build command. External Support Both Docker and Podman can expand functionality with external tools. The sections below present some of those tools and compare how Docker and Podman interact with them. Docker Swarm Docker Swarm is a container orchestration platform for managing Docker containers. It enables developers to run a cluster of Docker nodes and deploy a scalable application without other dependencies required. Podman does not support Docker Swarm. However, Podman users can use Nomad, which comes with a Podman driver. Note: To read more about Docker Swarm and compare it to Kubernetes, read Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes. Docker Compose Docker Compose is Docker's tool for managing multi-container application environments. It automates container initiation and management and streamlines the software development life cycle (SDLC). Previous versions of Podman did not have a way to simulate the Docker daemon necessary for Docker Compose to work, so they used less user-friendly alternatives like Podman Compose. However, as of version 3.0, Podman supports Docker Compose via podman.socket, a UNIX socket that replaces the Docker daemon. SELinux SELinux is a framework that provides an extra layer of security to Linux systems, built as an extension of Access Control Lists (ACLs). Docker has an SELinux module, but Podman's implementation is native and more user-friendly. On an SELinux-enabled OS, each container run by Podman has a SELinux label that prevents external processes from accessing the container's files. Security Docker is a secure tool, although some aspects of its design need attention from a security standpoint. Take the following into consideration when using Docker: Running containers in privileged mode is not recommended. Docker is secure only when the containers are run in the default, non-privileged mode. Docker can interfere with firewall rules. Iptables rules inserted by Docker are placed before firewall rules, effectively ignoring the firewall. Unless properly addressed, this behavior can cause serious security issues. Note: Docker's security can be increased further by enabling AppArmor, SELinux, and GRSEC, and applying security best practices. Podman's fork-exec architecture makes it a more secure solution than Docker. Below are some of the ways in which Podman provides more security: More in-depth audit logging. Podman's fork-exec model lets the system record the user modifying the system files correctly. However, the client-server approach that Docker uses does not provide this feature. Rootless containers. Assigning specific privileges to specific users gives administrators better access control for critical server components. No interference with firewall rules. Podman enables container networking by creating an internal network whose rules cannot override external firewall rules. Note: OCI containers hosted on Bare Metal Cloud offer better performance and efficiency than those hosted on cloud VMs. Podman vs. Docker: How to Choose Choose Docker if you: Prefer a well-documented tool. Docker's main advantage over Podman is its widespread use. A large amount of Docker-related support means that searching the internet can resolve many potential issues. Require container orchestration support. Docker Swarm support is another benefit of Docker. Users who want to orchestrate Podman containers must resort to less feature-rich alternatives than Docker Swarm or dive into Kubernetes. While popular, Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and may be too complex for simple projects. Choose Podman if you: Emphasize security. Podman's architecture is inherently more secure than Docker's. Plan to move to Kubernetes down the road. Podman introduces the pod concept, which makes it a good starting point for Kubernetes. Use systemd. One of the main benefits of Podman compared to Docker is that Podman fully integrates with systemd by default. This feature enables Podman to run systemd within the container out of the box. Podman vs. Docker: FAQ Since Podman and Docker have similar functionality and cater to the same use cases, deciding which one to use can be problematic. Below, you can find some of the most commonly asked questions concerning the comparison between Podman and Docker. Can Podman Replace Docker? Podman alone does not fully match Docker in features. However, using Podman alongside its companion tools (Buildah, Skopeo, Nomad, etc.) can fully replace Docker. Is Podman More Secure than Docker? Yes, Podman is rootless by design, which makes it a more secure solution. Its daemonless design removes the single point of failure created by Docker's central daemon. Is Podman Compatible with Docker? Since both Docker and Podman are OCI-compliant, they can be used side-by-side. For example, Docker's robustness can be employed on development machines, while dev, int, and prod environments can benefit from Podman's increased security. Can Docker Images Be Used with Podman? Yes, Podman can run containers with images created in Docker and vice versa. The two platforms support the same image format.

Container orchestration refers to automated process of managing, deploying, scaling, and networking containers within production environment. Containers package software applications with all the necessary dependencies, and orchestration helps coordinate how these containers work together across different hosts.Container orchestration automates the management of container lifecycles, ensuring applications run efficiently and scale to handle traffic spike also quickly recover from failures can handle increased traffic by scaling up and recover quickly from any failures. Popular container orchestration tools include Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, which handle tasks such as load balancing, resource allocation, and container health monitoring. What is Podman? Podman is a container management tool used by IT Business organizations to create, manage, and run containers on Linux-based systems. It is a kind of alternative to other container orchestration tools, such as Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Nomad. Podman is mainly a part of the container ecosystem and is designed for developers(users) who prefer a daemon-less and rootless container engine. Features of Podman The following are the features of Podman: Daemonless Architecture: Podman will operate the container process without a central daemon, to enhance the securtiy and reliability. Rootless Containers: It facilitates the users to run the containers without root privileges to reduce the security risks.

Scalability: With Docker containers developers can be easily scale up or down the resources to meet on-demand project needs. Improves Security: Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes applications more secure by limiting access needs. Who uses Podman and Docker? Podman and Docker are often used by developers, system administrators, and organizations looking for container management solutions that do not rely on a central daemon and provide a higher level of security through rootless operations. Both are helpful in CI/CD pipeline integration with enabling the automated testing, deployment and scaling of applications. Podman vs Docker: A Detailed Comparison In the above topics, we have seen about What is Podman and Docker? Let's understand more in detail with Comparison. Podman and Docker are standalone software packages with their code and dependencies. These two services are widely used in IT technology because they are lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability in any environment. They also allows developers to package software quickly and efficiently at scale. If you are working with Podman or Docker, you must understand the main difference, which is their model architecture. Generally, Docker uses a daemon-based architecture, whereas Podman doesn't have a daemon-based architecture as it works with a daemon-less architecture. Podman and Docker are compatible with any environment, as they support features to separate the software from the operating system. This kind of separation helps business organizations to control bugs, errors, and various challenges that arise during development or in different phases of the environment. Here in the table, you can find the detailed comparison between Podman and Docker: Feature Comparison Podman Docker Architecture Podman uses a Daemon-less Architecture. Docker uses a Daemon-based Architecture. Portability Podman is can work with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Docker will also with any OS such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. Compatibility If you have existing Docker and planning to Switch to Podman. Use can easily switch to Podman as it is compatible with Docker commands and Docker Compose. Docker or Docker Compose are not compatible with Podman commands or Podman Compose. But's it's not a issue at all as Podman works with docker commands. Security Podman is more secure when compared with Docker as it uses daemon-less architecture. Docker is less secure when compared with Podman as it uses daemon-based architecture. Here the resources utilization would be high and less secure. Lightweight/Less Resource Usage Podman is very lightweight than docker due it's daemon-less architecture model. It use very less resources at host machine which make deployment faster and easier for developers. Docker is also lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability but Podman takes the lead as it is more lightweight and porable on any operating-system.

However, as containerization became the norm in DevOps, competitors like Podman emerged as viable alternatives. This article will compare two container management engines - Docker and Podman. It will also help you choose the right engine for your needs. Note: Learn more about the differences between containers and VMs. What Is Docker? Docker is a popular platform for creating, deploying, and managing containers. Docker containers allow developers to apply a system-agnostic approach to software deployment. Since Docker runs the same containers on any operating system, containerized applications are cross-platform. What Is Podman? Podman is an open-source, daemonless, rootless container engine developed by RedHat and designed as an alternative to Docker. The modular design allows Podman to use individual system components only when needed. Its rootless approach to container management allows containers to be run by non-root users. Podman vs. Docker: Comparison In the following section, the article will go in-depth into the similarities and differences between Podman and Docker. Docker Podman Daemon Uses the Docker daemon. Daemonless architecture. Root Runs containers as root-only. Runs containers as root and as non-root. Images Can build container images. Uses Buildah to build container images. Architecture Client-server. Fork-exec. All-in-one platform Yes. No. Docker-swarm Supported. Not supported. Docker-compose Supported. Supported. SELinux support Via a module. Native. Firewall interaction Overrides firewall rules. Does not override the firewall. Runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL). Note: If you need Podman installed, refer to our installation guides on How to Install Podman on macOS and How to Install Podman on Ubuntu. Architecture Docker utilizes client-server architecture. The Docker daemon is a persistent background process that manages containers and maintains communication between the client and the server. The docker version command output shows separate sections for the client and the server versions: Another noteworthy feature of Docker is its all-in-one approach to container management. Docker provides all the necessary components for creating and running containers through its core application and integrated tools. Podman manages containers using the fork-exec model. Since Podman is a process and does not use the client-server paradigm, it does not require a daemon to run. Podman containers are child processes of the primary Podman process. Using the podman version command shows that Podman lists only one version number: The central unit of Podman architecture is a container. However, Podman also introduces the pod concept. Like Kubernetes pods, Podman pods are groups of one or more containers that share the same system resources. The pod comprises the main container and sidecar (infra) containers supporting it. Unlike Docker, which attempts to provide a single solution to containerization, Podman has been designed to run containers. Users perform the rest of the container management operations by extending Podman's functionality with additional tools such as: Buildah for image creation. Skopeo for image distribution and image repository manipulation. Nomad for scheduling and orchestration. Note: Find out how Nomad compares to Kubernetes. Ease of Use Docker features a comprehensive set of intuitive commands. With Docker, developers can easily create, deploy, and manage containerized applications. Podman was built to replace Docker in a software development workflow seamlessly, so its commands are mostly the same as Docker's. For example, the docker pull command becomes podman pull: Aside from Podman inheriting the ease of use of Docker, the similarity between the two tools also means that the migration from Docker to Podman requires little effort. Daemon Usage and Root Privileges Docker features a background daemon process called dockerd. The daemon receives commands via Docker CLI and handles all the container management operations. The Docker's architecture requires the daemon to run as the root user, so the users need root privileges to interact with it. Podman does not feature a central daemon process. Instead, Podman commands run as separate processes that do not require superuser privileges. Rootless Execution Users who are not in the docker UNIX group must run Docker commands using the sudo command. Running Docker in rootless mode is possible but requires installing additional packages and specific storage drivers. Podman is rootless by design. Thanks to its modular architecture, granting different privileges to different users is possible. Building Images Docker uses the docker build command to build container images from a Dockerfile and a build context. The build context is a set of files specified in the Dockerfile used in container creation. Podman features the podman build command that uses a syntax similar to docker build. However, Podman performs the building process using Buildah, another open-source tool. When podman build is executed, the buildah bud (build-using-dockerfile) command is called to emulate the docker build command. External Support Both Docker and Podman can expand functionality with external tools. The sections below present some of those tools and compare how Docker and Podman interact with them. Docker Swarm Docker Swarm is a container orchestration platform for managing Docker containers. It enables developers to run a cluster of Docker nodes and deploy a scalable application without other dependencies required. Podman does not support Docker Swarm. However, Podman users can use Nomad, which comes with a Podman driver. Note: To read more about Docker Swarm and compare it to Kubernetes, read Docker Swarm vs. Kubernetes. Docker Compose Docker Compose is Docker's tool for managing multi-container application environments. It automates container initiation and management and streamlines the software development life cycle (SDLC). Previous versions of Podman did not have a way to simulate the Docker daemon necessary for Docker Compose to work, so they used less user-friendly alternatives like Podman Compose. However, as of version 3.0, Podman supports Docker Compose via podman.socket, a UNIX socket that replaces the Docker daemon. SELinux SELinux is a framework that provides an extra layer of security to Linux systems, built as an extension of Access Control Lists (ACLs). Docker has an SELinux module, but Podman's implementation is native and more user-friendly. On an SELinux-enabled OS, each container run by Podman has a SELinux label that prevents external processes from accessing the container's files. Security Docker is a secure tool, although some aspects of its design need attention from a security standpoint. Take the following into consideration when using Docker: Running containers in privileged mode is not recommended. Docker is secure only when the containers are run in the default, non-privileged mode. Docker can interfere with firewall rules. Iptables rules inserted by Docker are placed before firewall rules, effectively ignoring the firewall. Unless properly addressed, this behavior can cause serious security issues. Note: Docker's security can be increased further by enabling AppArmor, SELinux, and GRSEC, and applying security best practices. Podman's fork-exec architecture makes it a more secure solution than Docker. Below are some of the ways in which Podman provides more security: More in-depth audit logging. Podman's fork-exec model lets the system record the user modifying the system files correctly. However, the client-server approach that Docker uses does not provide this feature. Rootless containers. Assigning specific privileges to specific users gives administrators better access control for critical server components. No interference with firewall rules. Podman enables container networking by creating an internal network whose rules cannot override external firewall rules. Note: OCI containers hosted on Bare Metal Cloud offer better performance and efficiency than those hosted on cloud VMs. Podman vs. Docker: How to Choose Choose Docker if you: Prefer a well-documented tool. Docker's main advantage over Podman is its widespread use. A large amount of Docker-related support means that searching the internet can resolve many potential issues. Require container orchestration support. Docker Swarm support is another benefit of Docker. Users who want to orchestrate Podman containers must resort to less feature-rich alternatives than Docker Swarm or dive into Kubernetes. While popular, Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and may be too complex for simple projects. Choose Podman if you: Emphasize security. Podman's architecture is inherently more secure than Docker's. Plan to move to Kubernetes down the road. Podman introduces the pod concept, which makes it a good starting point for Kubernetes. Use systemd. One of the main benefits of Podman compared to Docker is that Podman fully integrates with systemd by default. This feature enables Podman to run systemd within the container out of the box. Podman vs. Docker: FAQ Since Podman and Docker have similar functionality and cater to the same use cases, deciding which one to use can be problematic. Below, you can find some of the most commonly asked questions concerning the comparison between Podman and Docker. Can Podman Replace Docker? Podman alone does not fully match Docker in features. However, using Podman alongside its companion tools (Buildah, Skopeo, Nomad, etc.) can fully replace Docker. Is Podman More Secure than Docker? Yes, Podman is rootless by design, which makes it a more secure solution. Its daemonless design removes the single point of failure created by Docker's central daemon. Is Podman Compatible with Docker? Since both Docker and Podman are OCI-compliant, they can be used side-by-side. For example, Docker's robustness can be employed on development machines, while dev, int, and prod environments can benefit from Podman's increased security. Can Docker Images Be Used with Podman? Yes, Podman can run containers with images created in Docker and vice versa. The two platforms support the same image format.

This feature improves security by limiting attacks and preventing containers from the host system. Pod Support: Pods are lightweight groups where one or more containers can share resources and can be managed as a single unit. Compatibility with Docker: Podman is compatible with Docker. You can use similar Docker and Docker Compose commands to manage Podman containers. What is Docker? Docker is a popular container management tool similar to Podman which is used for developing, testing, and deploying web applications. Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS). It is used for running microservices, which are small, independent applications that can be combined to create a larger application. Docker containers are lightweight and portable so you can run on any operating system platform such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. Docker use operating-system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes docker a secure and efficient way to run applications. Key Features of Docker Improved Productivity: consistent building and testing applications. Faster Deployment: Docker containers can quickly and easily be deployed on any OS platform. Efficient Resource Utilization: Docker containers are lightweight and isolate resources. which can help to improve the utilization of hardware resources. Scalability: With Docker containers developers can be easily scale up or down the resources to meet on-demand project needs. Improves Security: Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine. This makes applications more secure by limiting access needs. Who uses Podman and Docker? Podman and Docker are often used by developers, system administrators, and organizations looking for container management solutions that do not rely on a central daemon and provide a higher level of security through rootless operations. Both are helpful in CI/CD pipeline integration with enabling the automated testing, deployment and scaling of applications. Podman vs Docker: A Detailed Comparison In the above topics, we have seen about What is Podman and Docker? Let's understand more in detail with Comparison. Podman and Docker are standalone software packages with their code and dependencies. These two services are widely used in IT technology because they are lightweight, portable, and provide faster deployment and scalability in any environment. They also allows developers to package software quickly and efficiently at scale. If you are working with Podman or Docker, you must understand the main difference, which is their model architecture. Generally, Docker uses a daemon-based architecture, whereas Podman doesn't have a daemon-based architecture as it works with a daemon-less architecture. Podman and Docker are compatible with any environment, as they support features to separate the software from the operating system. This kind of separation helps business organizations to control bugs, errors, and various challenges that arise during development or in different phases of the environment. Here in the table, you can find the detailed comparison between Podman and Docker: Feature Comparison Podman Docker Architecture Podman uses a Daemon-less Architecture.

            "body": "ConfigZen Trending Blog Mitigating Security Risks: Docker vs Podman Explained COLLABORATION CONTINUOUS-IMPROVEMENT DEVOPS DOCKER OBSERVABILITY Published on August 26, 2024 Mitigating Security Risks: Docker vs Podman Explained In a world increasingly reliant on containerization for development and deployment, understanding the security implications of our tools is paramount. Docker has long been the go-to container management tool, but Podman has emerged as a challenger. In this post, we will dive into the security features of both Docker and Podman, highlighting their differences, use cases, and how they can help you mitigate risks. Understanding Containers Before we delve deeper, let's briefly discuss what containers are. Containers allow developers to package applications and their dependencies in a single encapsulated unit that can run consistently on any environment. This architecture offers significant advantages, such as modular development, improved resource utilization, and simplified deployment. However, with these advantages come potential security risks, including: Exploitation of container vulnerabilities Ingress and egress security issues Container escape risks Thus, a thorough understanding of the security aspects of Docker and Podman is crucial for modern development practices. Docker: The Traditional Heavyweight Docker is widely regarded as the pioneer of container technology. While its popularity is well-established, it does have some security concerns. Security Features of Docker Namespaces and Cgroups: Docker leverages Linux namespaces and control groups (cgroups) to isolate containers at various levels. Namespaces provide the abstraction that separates containers from each other, while cgroups limit the resources a container can use. Docker Daemon: The Docker architecture involves a daemon that manages the containers and requires root privileges. This centralized daemon can become a single point of failure and a potential target for attackers. # Commands to run Docker containers docker run -dt --name my_container nginx In the command above, you run an NGINX container. However, note that running it through Docker means it operates under the control of the Docker daemon, which runs with elevated privileges. User Namespaces: Docker offers the ability to map the user namespace of your host's user to a user in the container. This is a good practice to prevent privilege escalation attacks. { \"userns-remap\": \"default\" } Including this in your Docker config file ensures that the user in the container does not have the same privileges as the host user, adding a layer of security. Risks of Docker While Docker has many security features, it is not without risks: Centralized Control: The Docker daemon runs as root, making it a potential target for unauthorized access. Image Vulnerabilities: Docker images can come with vulnerabilities if not managed carefully. It's vital to use minimal images and keep them up-to-date. Podman: The New Contender Podman, short for \"Pod Manager,\" is a relatively newer tool that aims to be Docker-compatible while addressing some of the security concerns associated with Docker. Security Features of Podman Daemonless Architecture: Podman does not rely on a central daemon. Each Podman command is executed by a separate process. This architecture improves security, as there’s no persistent service running that could be exploited. # Commands to run Podman containers podman run -dt --name my_pod_container nginx In this case, the command runs in its process space, thereby isolating it from persistent attacks on a daemon. Rootless Containers: One of the most significant security features of Podman is its ability to run containers as a non-root user. This minimizes the risk of privilege escalation. podman run -u 1000:1000 -dt nginx By using the -u flag, you're specifying that the container should run as a non-root user, providing an additional safety mechanism. Compatibility with Kubernetes: Podman supports Kubernetes, which allows for easier integration into existing workflows and environments. This facilitates expanding security measures across cloud-native applications. Mitigating Risks with Podman No Central Daemon: The absence of a central daemon reduces the risk of exploitation. User Isolation: Running as non-root by default allows you to limit potential damage in a breach scenario. Comparing Docker and Podman | Feature | Docker | Podman | |---------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------| | Daemon Architecture | Requires a central daemon | Daemonless; each command acts in separate processes | | User Privileges | Typically runs as root | Can run as a non-root user by default | | Command Compatibility | Prime tool with community support | Docker CLI-compatible for ease of transition | | Kubernetes Integration | Works through Docker Desktop; not inherently built-in | natively compatible with Kubernetes | Making the Choice Choosing between Docker and Podman largely depends on your use case and security requirements: If you're looking for a well-established tool with extensive support and a robust ecosystem, Docker might be the right choice. However, you will need to implement additional security measures such as user namespaces and careful image management. If you prioritize security and prefer running containers in a rootless manner without a central daemon, Podman is a compelling alternative. It’s user-friendly and features robust security out of the box. Wrapping Up Securing containerized environments is non-negotiable in today’s threat landscape. While Docker has served businesses well, Podman offers security advantages that cannot be overlooked. As your applications and services evolve, continuously evaluating your tools and their security implications will help you better mitigate risks. For further reading on Docker and Podman's security features, check out the official Docker documentation and the Podman guide. Embracing these modern tools with an eye for security will prepare your organization for future challenges in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. By understanding the nuances of Docker and Podman, you empower yourself with the knowledge to make an informed decision for your development workflow while enhancing your security posture.

In this article, I use real-world examples to show you how to install Podman, use its basic commands, and transition from the Docker command-line interface (CLI) to Podman. You'll also see how to run an existing image with Podman and how to set up port forwarding. What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux-native tool designed to develop, manage, and run Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and pods. Being daemonless means Podman does not use a long-running background process (a daemon) unlike Docker, which contributes to its increased security and lightweight design. It also has a similar structure to similar tools such as Buildah, Skopeo, and CRI-O. Install Podman Head to the official documentation to learn how to install Podman for your machine. For example, if you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9), enter the command: $ dnf -y install podman You may be using yum, if so replace yum with dnf. If Linux is unavailable, you can use Podman Desktop for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Using the Podman CLI One of Podman's greatest advantages is its CLI compatibility with Docker. In fact, when building Podman, Docker users can adapt without any significant changes. For example, you can use the alias command to create a docker alias for Podman: $ alias docker=podman You can run familiar commands, such as pull, push, build, commit, tag, and more with Podman. You can also use Podman to run secure, rootless containers. By joining a user namespace and setting root access inside, you can enable Podman to mount certain filesystems and set up the container with no escalation of privileges. Run an existing image using Podman Fortunately, images created by Docker and Podman are compatible with the OCI standard. This means that Podman can push and pull from container registries such as the Docker Hub and Quay.io. For example, let's test the Funbox container, which combines terminal commands and ASCII art. To start, clone the repository in a local directory with the following git commands: $ git clone https://github.com/wernight/docker-funbox.git Once you download the necessary files, you can pull the base image and additional requirements to build and run a container: $ podman run --rm -it wernight/funbox In this case, we've used the following tags with the podman run command: The --rm tag removes the container after it exits. The -it tag connects the container to the terminal so that you can interact with it. We now have a container active and running (mine is running on top of Debian Jessie). Let's add an argument to view the Funbox in action: $ podman run --rm -it wernight/funbox nyancat Figure 1: Nyan Cat in terminal from running container. If you see a Nyan Cat displayed on your console screen, you are all set to deploy and interact with a container using Podman. Running and setting up a container with Podman Dozens of base images are available to download and use with Podman. For this example, let's set up a simple Apache HTTP Server 2.4 in a CentOS container. To begin, pull the base image you want to use from the Docker Hub: $ podman pull centos:latest Once you've created the base image, use podman images to check whether the container is ready to use. You should see output similar to what's shown in Figure 2: Figure 2: The container is ready to use To run the new container with your base image, use the podman run command with specific tags (such as -it) to attach it to the CLI. Use --name to define a custom name. Finally, define the base image where the container should run: $ podman run -it --name redhat-website centos:latest When the container is running, automatically set root access inside to run all commands. Create the Apache HTTP server To create an Apache web server, we can install the httpd program with the default package installer. For CentOS, it's yum: $ yum install -y httpd The following image shows the container running and installation of httpd. Figure 3: Console output for the yum install command. You can now serve content from your container to your server's public IP address. Create a web page Next, we will add text to an index.html file in the container's var/www/html directory. Feel free to customize your message, or add the default below: $ echo 'Hello from Red Hat!' > /var/www/html/index.html When you are finished, type exit to shut down or power off the container. Use podman commit to commit your changes. Use tags to define a name and a custom version for your customized container: $ podman commit redhat-website redhat-website:v1 Finally, launch the container, then forward all requests made to your server's public IP address on port 8080 to port 80 on the container. Use the Podman tag -p to port forward, and specify the container that you want to run. Ensure that httpd is running as a foreground process: $ podman run -p 8080:80 redhat-website:v1 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND To view the web page from the host device, run a curl command while specifying port 8080. You should see the screen shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: A successful example of port forwarding using Podman. How to stop and remove a container You can use the podman stop command to stop a specified container: $ podman stop redhat-website Use podman rm to remove the container: $ podman rm redhat-website Conclusion Every command that I demonstrated in this article is compatible with the Docker CLI. Podman also has great integration features through systemd. You can use it to run rootless containers, and it is a powerful tool for running OCI containers on RHEL, and whatever your system may be. You can continue to experiment with Podman by setting up this lab, which offers an interactive environment directly in your browser where you can containerize your application with Buildah and Podman. If you need container orchestration, you can use Podman with Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift. To get started with these platforms, see kubernetesbyexample.com and developers.redhat.com/learn.

Docker compatibility is a way to configure an environment in which you can run your Docker applications, commands, and tools on a Podman engine without reconfiguration. It encompasses two stages: Import your saved containers into Podman Desktop using CLI. Access the Docker Compatibility settings to configure a Docker-compatible environment based on your needs.

Home - Home Server - Ultimate Docker to Podman Migration Guide: It’s NOT difficult Ultimate Docker to Podman Migration Guide: It’s NOT difficult December 13, 2022 by Kristopher Leaving Docker is like taking away your favorite old teddy bear – painful at first, but you’ll grow from it! Let’s migrate from Docker to Podman. This guide will help make your transition easier. Facebook Twitter Reddit LinkedIn 共有 In my previous article, I wrote on the benefits of using Podman as a replacement for Docker. This guide is intended to be a follow up to that article by giving the reader a working example of how one might migrate from using Docker to Podman. I will use a few examples taken from Anand's fantastic Docker Media Server article. [Read: 60+ Best Docker Containers for Home Server Beginners 2023] Editor's Note: This post was written by Kristopher based on his experience. Anand's Docker-Traefik GitHub repo will continue to use Docker and there are no plans to switch over to Podman. Also, just because Podman offers some advantages does not mean that Docker is unfit for the purpose most homelabers use it for. Table of Contents [show] ABOUT THIS PODMAN MIGRATION GUIDE Recall, Podman is simply a container runtime. What this means for you is that all of the introductory content written by Anand on containerization applies here as well. Therefore, I will jump straight into the details of getting your Docker containers running in a Podman environment. There are some new concepts to learn along the way; please take your time, take notes, and read through each section. I have done my best to write this guide at a novice level. But some of what I am going to cover I consider to be intermediate-level topics. If this is your first time diving into containers or the Linux command line, I recommend starting with Anand's Docker guides. That being said, I do not intend for this to be a \"just copy and paste what you see here\" guide. Instead, I hope to give the reader some tools to build their own server in a way they see fit. After all, it is YOU who is responsible for what you decide to run. Knowing HOW it was put together will only aid you in the long run. Are you considering switching from Docker to Podman? Yes No I do not know View Results Prerequisites for Replacing Docker with Podman Podman is the native container runtime in all Red Hat based systems. This means it's very well integrated as the default for users of RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, and other derivatives. Personally, I prefer this ecosystem as it comes with other features I find useful. However, I know many readers of this site tend to use Ubuntu and other Debian based distributions. Thus, this guide will be written using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish as a base. As such I must warn you: Podman support on Ubuntu isn't great; the repositories are stuck many versions behind. That means there is some functionality that does not work as expected, and it might take a bit of finessing. Consider yourself warned. To follow along, you will need: Ubuntu server 22.04 LTS Basic understanding of CLI Linux Basic understanding of containerization Basic understanding of YAML file format And most importantly: Patience Coming from Docker to Podman This article is written from a standalone perspective, meaning a bare server with nothing installed is preferred. However, since many of you will be transitioning from Docker on the same installation, I will give some tips along the way to help ease the transition. The tips will be in blue boxes like the following statement below. For those of you following along from a standalone perspective, you can ignore these boxes. Docker Users: I will begin by shutting down Docker (but not uninstalling it immediately). 1 sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down Verify you don't have any stray containers still running: 1 sudo docker ps -a Stop All Of Your Running Containers To Avoid Conflicts. You should see no other containers running. If you have others listed, be sure to stop and remove them as well. Leaving containers running could interfere with Podman if they are bound to ports we want to use via Podman. INTRO TO THE WORLD OF ROOTLESS CONTAINERS I know, the last thing you want is some theory to get started. But I promise to keep it short, concise, and most importantly, relevant to the guide: Namespaces vs Rootless Namespaces. In my previous article, I discussed one of the biggest benefits of using Podman is its rootless design. I gave some examples, but now it's time to put the theory into practice. The below sections might be a bit dense, but do your best to follow along. If it's too much, move forward to the next section and return here when I refer to it later in the article.

Podman can easily be installed with the standard Ubuntu repositories. As of writing this, Podman in the official Ubuntu repositories is at version 3.4.4. In February 2022, a large update to Podman (version 4.0+), was made which rewrote their entire networking stack. The only limitation I have found with Podman version 3.4.4 is that networking between containers can be difficult at times, even within the same pod. Regardless, everything still works and this article will stick with Podman version 3.4.4. 1 sudo apt install podman Installing Podman Brings Lots Of Other Tools Like Buildah For Building Images. By installing Podman, we will be getting a load of other supporting software along with the program itself. As stated in my previous article, Podman is actually a set of different tools that perform different functions in the container ecosystem. I'll spare you the details of what each software does, but if it interests you, there are numerous articles on each software. Podman-compose Just like Docker, Podman is able to work with compose files - greatly speeding up deploying, redeploying containers, and even transition from Docker to Podman. Podman-compose is a program written in the Python programming language. Thus, the easiest way to install it is via Python's module installer called pip3, short for Package Installer for Python. At the time of writing this, the pip repositories have the latest version of podman-compose at version 1.0.3. That was released 10 months ago, and there have been numerous fixes put into the as-of-yet unreleased version 1.0.4. For now we will stick on 1.0.3, but if there are breaking changes in 1.0.4, I will update this article. 1 pip3 install --user podman-compose==1.0.3 Note: The install command above is used with the --user switch to only install it for the current user. After the name of the package (podman-compose), we can specify which version we require. In this case, we are asking for the exact version with == : 1.0.3. If you are receiving the error: Command 'pip3' not found, pip3 can be installed by issuing the command: 1 sudo apt install python3-pip Install Podman-Compose Via Pip. Hopefully everything installed fine and we are good to go! Move on to the next section. PODMAN AND PODMAN-COMPOSE Fortunately for us, Podman is described as a \"drop-in replacement\" for Docker. And it's true. All of the commands you are familiar with work the same with Podman as they did for Docker. Refer to Anand's Docker Beginners Guide for reference. In most cases, simply substitute the word \"docker\" for \"podman\" and you're in business. The Podman Commands Are Identical To Docker. One huge difference, however, is that we are running in a rootless environment. That means that we don't need to add our user to a Podman group, or use sudo when running Podman commands. This does however come with a few caveats which I will discuss below. Basic Podman Commands Podman commands generally follow the exact same syntax as what you're familiar with for Docker and docker-compose. For example: To show all containers (running and stopped): 1 podman ps -a To start your compose file: 1 podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d The rest follow along exactly the same as Anand's article. Pods Example Of How Pods Work. One main difference from Docker to Podman is the use of Pods. Pods are a type of container holding a collections of containers. The primary use for pods is when you want to setup a single application that uses multiple containers. Let's say, for example, you decide to setup Nextcloud which can use 3 different containers for even a basic installation. By putting them in the same pod, you can start and stop them together, and even interconnect them using \"localhost\" as if they were already in the same container. When running containers alone, Podman will not create a pod to put them in by default. The containers can run standalone just like Docker. For example, you could put all the CrowdSec related containers in a pod.

Thus, I will not be covering them in this guide. SETUP HOST SYSTEM FOR ROOTLESS CONTAINERS Before diving straight into replacing Docker with Podman, we must take a few steps to setup our rootless environment. When you run containers using Docker, ultimately, the root user is behind the actions. The consequence is that there are a few system restrictions that do not apply to the root user but will apply to our user. Let's take a look at them before we start using Podman. Docker as an Image Source Registry With Docker, pulling images occurs automatically using their own docker.io repository. Podman however, was originally designed to run in the Red Hat environment and thus use Red Hat derived image repositories. Podman on Ubuntu, for some odd reason, has no default registries included at all! An annoyance, but an easy fix. Oddly Enough, Podman On Ubuntu Comes With No Image Repositories Active. Podman allows us add any, and as many, repositories as we'd like, including docker.io. By default, Podman will read the global settings from the /etc/containers/registries.conf file. To override it and add the Docker repository permanently, we will create a local settings file. Copy the Registries Config File Copy the above mentioned file, and place it in your user's ~/.config directory: 1 2 mkdir --parents /home/rairdev/.config/containers cp /etc/containers/registries.conf /home/rairdev/.config/containers/ Note: The first command creates the containers directory. If we don't have the .config directory already, the --parents flag will create it as well. Add Docker as a Registry Using your preferred text editor, open the file we just copied. I found the comments within the file to be rather obtuse. So I compared its contents to the same file on my Fedora machine and quickly found that we just need to add docker.io as an \"unqualified-search-registry\". Head to the bottom of the config file and add: 1 unqualified-search-registries = [\"docker.io\"] Note: If you would like to add other registries to pull images from in the future, all you need to do is add them to the array (list): 1 unqualified-search-registries = [\"docker.io\", \"registry.fedoraproject.org\"] Save and exit. Done! Every time you run Podman as your user, Podman will see this file and use your defined registries to find container images. Creating And Modifying The Default Registries Config Allows Us To Pull The Image Now. Enable Containers to Run After Logout By default, when using Docker containers, logging-out of your server does not stop the containers. Why? Because the Docker process is running as the root user. The root user is allowed to continue running processes in the background even when not logged-in. As we will be running in a rootless environment, we don't have the same privilege by default. Video Player https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/images/2022/11/logout-container-stop-av1.webm 00:00 00:17 Since we will be running containers as a regular user, we need to enable their processes to \"linger\", or remain active, even if not logged in. 1 sudo loginctl enable-linger rairdev This simple one-liner will allow my user (rairdev) to run containers, logout, and keep the containers running in the background. Video Player https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/images/2022/11/logout-container-run.webm 00:00 00:09 Allow Containers Use of HTTP/HTTPS Ports A default security measure is to deny non-root users binding ports below 1024. Ports below 1024 are known as \"privileged ports\". We can test this by trying to run a container on port 80: 1 podman run --rm -p 80:80 nginx:alpine Trying To Bind To Ports Under 1024 Results In An Error. This is problematic as we want to access our services through the default HTTP/HTTPS (80 and 443 respectively) ports. Take note: The error message tells us exactly what we need to do to - add a line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file. Create a New Configuration File We can follow the directions above exactly, but there's a risk that the /etc/sysctl.conf file gets overwritten during a system update. To ensure this setting doesn't get removed, we can create a separate sub-configuration file under /etc/sysctl.d/ with the corrected setting: Opening The Sysctl Config File Gives Us A Valuable Piece Of Info At The Very Top Of The File. Note: This line at the top of the /etc/sysctl.conf file tells us that the system will read variables from files in the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory. Let's create a file in that directory, named something we will recognize later: 1 sudo -e /etc/sysctl.d/podman-privileged-ports.conf Note: Using sudo with the -e switch is a quick way to tell the system we want to \"edit\" the file listed. We are creating a new file called podman-privileged-ports.conf within the /etc/sysctl.d/ directory, where other config files of the same nature are stored by default. We are greeted with a blank file. Let's add a comment at the top so when our future-selves find this file, we will know where it came from! 1 2 3 # Lowering privileged ports to 80 to allow us to run rootless Podman containers on lower ports # From: www.smarthomebeginner.com # default: 1024 Below my comments, we just need to copy and paste the exact line from the error message shown above: 1 net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80 Save the file and exit. Make the Setting Permanent Finally, to load the setting we just created: 1 sudo sysctl --load /etc/sysctl.d/podman-privileged-ports.conf You should see the setting printed in your console. For those interested, we can run the quick test again to ensure it worked: 1 podman run --rm -p 80:80 nginx:alpine Now We Can Run A Container On Port 80, And See It Running In A Browser. OK, great! Our system is setup and ready to use. SETUP OUR PODMAN ENVIRONMENT Following along with Anand's previous article, he sets you up with a file and directory structure. For the purpose of simplicity, I will follow his way of doing things and keep the naming scheme identical. Directories and Files According to his article, we don't need much to get started. Follow along there for descriptions of what we're doing if needed. Let's begin by creating the docker directory, and inside it the appdata directory. Docker Users: We can easily re-use the same files and directories from your Docker setup, so no need to change anything here. These Permissions Won't Exactly Work For A \"Rootless\" Environment! However, as we will be running rootless, make sure to change ownership of the files to your current user: 1 sudo chown -R rairdev:rairdev ~/docker This will change any files you had owned as root to your user. This is critical or Podman won't be able to access those files! 1 2 mkdir -p ~/docker/appdata cd docker Note: We are creating both directories in a single command just like we did above. This time I used the abbreviated -p flag which is the same as using --parent. Next, we need both the .env environmental variables file, as well as the docker-compose.yml file iteself. 1 touch .env docker-compose.yml And lastly, let's set some stricter permissions for the .env file since it could contain some sensitive information. 1 chmod 600 .env Note: In Anand's article, he sets the ownership of the .env file to the root user. For our rootless Podman environment, you can probably deduce that nothing can be owned by root for our user to use it. Thus we will keep it owned by our user. What we lost in minimal security benefit we can make up for with Podman secrets. Default Directory Permissions Differing from Anand's article, we don't need to set a default group owner for our files. Having them owned by our user is perfectly sufficient. If you would like a tiny bit of added security, we can restrict access to other users in one of two ways: Using umask: The umask command can be used to set a default permission for newly created files and directories. It is used in a deductive fashion. Therefore, if we wanted to create new files without other users permissions added, we would use umask 007 to remove all (7 = rwx) permissions. Remember, you must run the umask command before creating any files or directories. However, the big caveat is that this is reset each time you logout and login. Using Access Control Lists (ACL's): Similar to Anand's article, we can use ACL's to set default permissions for the entire filesystem within our docker directory. This is a bit overkill, but can be done with: 1 sudo setfacl -Rdm o::--- /home/rairdev/docker Here we modify (-m) the default (-d) ACL's for the docker directory recursively (-R) to remove all permissions (---) from other users (o::). I will let you decide which method you prefer. Generally speaking, it is more critical to ensure you have followed some basic good-security practices for securing the host system from outside users. Environmenal Variables in the .env File The environmental variables help us to set recurring configuration settings in multiple containers. For the time being, you can use the exact same as what's in Anand's guide. Docker Users: You can also safely leave the PUID and PGID variables at 1000, but you may notice that your apps won't be able to access your previous data. If that's the case, you would need to change ownership of the files. That's done with the chown command. However, things get a little tricky when using Podman within a user namespace. If you followed my explanation above, you would see that anything owned by user 1000 within the container, is actually user 100999 outside of the container. So we can just use the following right? 1 chown -R rairdev:100999 /home/rairdev/docker/appdata/heimdall If These Subuids Belong To Our User, Why Doesn't This Work? Oops! Not permitted! That's because we don't have permission to change ownership outside of our user in this namespace. That is a critical point. But what if we were the root user? To become the \"root\" user within our Podman namespace, we use a command known as podman unshare. This drops us into our user namespace, so the following command is run as the \"root\" user from rootless Podman's perspective. So instead, it should look like: 1 podman unshare chown -R root:1000 /home/rairdev/docker/appdata/heimdall NB: I changed the group to 1000 in the second command. Remember now I'm running this command within the user namespace. Have a look at the file ownership now: Using Podman Unshare Gives Us The Expected Permissions. You may have noticed that I have left the PUID and PGID variables the same as Anand's Docker article. While I tried to find an easier work around, the LSIO images are quite particular and have some attributes that cause them to not play nice with Podman. BUILDING OUR PODMAN STACK As mentioned in the introduction, this article is not intended to be a full replacement for the Docker guide, but simply a starting point for Podman. With that in mind, I'll get you started with a few apps, and some tips to keep in mind when using Podman instead of Docker. Docker Users: I recommend creating a new file to play with, while leaving the old docker-compose.yml file untouched. Call the new file anything you like - podman.yml for example. When we run our podman-compose up command, simply substitute the docker-compose.yml filename with the correct name you set. Note that you do not need the \"version\" declaration at the top of your compose file as it has no effect in Podman. Leave it, delete it, there's no difference here. Networks Since we are using podman-compose version 1.0.3, we can declare networks in our compose file, but not control the subnet they will use. Note: If you absolutely need to use a specific subnet, check out the optional section just below. Open your compose file and add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ########################### NETWORKS ########################### # You may only customize the network subnet (192.168.89.0/24) below if you are using # Podman-Compose version 1.0.4 or higher. networks: npm_proxy: name: npm_proxy # ipam: # config: # - subnet: 192.168.89.0/24 (Optional) Create your NPM Proxy Network Separately If you would like to use a spefic subnet with your npm_proxy network (or any other networks for that matter), you will have to manually create the network before starting your podman-compose file. This issue has been fixed in the unreleased version 1.0.4 of Podman-Compose. Creating a network with a specific subnet in Podman is simple. 1 podman network create --subnet 192.168.89.0/24 npm_proxy To verify the network, we can inspect it: 1 podman network inspect npm_proxy A Small Workaround For Custom Subnets Until Podman-Compose V. 1.0.4 Extension Fields If we are re-using certain declarations again and again, we can simplify our compose file by simply calling these extension field \"groups\". Below your networks declaration from above, we can add the extension fields similar (but not identical) to Anand's Docker article. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 ########################### EXTENSION FIELDS # Helps eliminate repetition of sections # More Info on how to use this: https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik/pull/228 # Common environment values x-environment: &default-tz-puid-pgid TZ: $TZ PUID: $PUID PGID: $PGID # Keys common to some of the core services that we always to automatically restart on failure x-common-keys-core: &common-keys-core networks: - npm_proxy security_opt: - no-new-privileges restart: always # Keys common to some of the dependent services/apps x-common-keys-apps: &common-keys-apps networks: - npm_proxy security_opt: - no-new-privileges restart: unless-stopped # Keys common to some of the services in media-services.txt x-common-keys-media: &common-keys-media networks: - npm_proxy security_opt: - no-new-privileges restart: \"no\" Great! With that out of the way we will move onto the services themselves. Services Declaration Before adding containers, we simply need to identify where our container declarations will start. Give yourself a couple of lines below the extensions heading and add the following: 1 2 #################### SERVICES ################## services: Note that there are no spaces before the services: declaration. Any containers we declare after this, will begin with 2 spaces to denote that they will exist within this services: declaration. Frontends While not my favorite name for these pieces of software, they are designed to sit \"in front\" of your other containers/applications. Thus, they act as a \"doorway\" of sorts to our other containers. Both of these pieces of software are Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) that are not entirely necessary, but can be helpful if you are still learning and the command line is intimidating.

JOIN THE GEEK ARMY (starting from just $1.67/month) Why did we start Memberships? Nginx Proxy Manager A Gui For Nginx As A Reverse Proxy. In this section, we will be adding Nginx Proxy Manager as a reverse proxy. This piece of software adds a nice user interface to the popular NGINX webserver common throughout the internet. Acting as a reverse proxy, NPM allows us to access all of our containers via a domain name (like https://service.example.com) instead of having to remember IP addresses and port numbers. The setup is fairly straight forward and similar to Anand's. Open your compose file, and add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 # Nginx Proxy Manager - Reverse Proxy with LetsEncrypt npm: <<: *common-keys-core # See EXTENSION FIELDS at the top container_name: nginx-proxy-manager # Use the fully qualified name to pull including the docker.io portion image: 'docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest' # We will let Podman assign a Dynamic IP networks: - npm_proxy # If you REALLY need a static IP (normally not necessary) and are using podman-compose version <= 1.0.3, # you will need to create the npm_proxy network manually with podman, using the --subnet flag.

Internal Home Network Access only. volumes: - $DOCKERDIR/appdata/npm/config:/config - $DOCKERDIR/appdata/npm/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt - $DOCKERDIR/appdata/npm/data:/data environment: DB_SQLITE_FILE: \"/config/database.sqlite\" DISABLE_IPV6: 'true' Note that the main difference between the above and Anand's compose file is that I'm not setting a static IP. My personal preference is to not set static IP's at all, and instead refer to containers by their names. This allows any IP changes to be insignificant to us, as Podman's internal DNS will always point us to the correct address regardless. After adding the above, save and close. Before starting our container, recall that Podman does not alter our firewall rules like Docker does (another security enhancement). Thus, you will need to open ports 80, 443, and 81 in ufw: 1 sudo ufw allow 80,443,81/tcp comment Nginx-Proxy-Manager Now we can start the container using: 1 podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d Using The Podman-Compose Up Command Is Quite Verbose. Now let's have a look at the app itself: Open a browser on your desktop and type in http://your-server-ip:81 Note: If you don't know your server's IP, you can find it with: 1 ip -4 address I highly recommend setting your server as a static DHCP lease in your router! This should bring you to the login page for Nginx-Proxy-Manager. Npm Can Be Reached Using The Ip And Port For Now. At this point you are at the same point in Anand's article titled: \"Setting Up Reverse Proxy for Nginx Proxy Manager's Web Interface\". Follow along to finish setting up your Nginx Proxy Manager with Podman. Cockpit Cockpit Can Manage And Monitor More Than Just Containers. I realize many of you are probably wondering where Portainer has gone for this section, but see my note below on why I decided to exclude it. Also, I wanted to introduce you to another option for managing your server. If you are bent on using Portainer, it is possible to make it work with Podman using the instructions below. Cockpit is a web-based GUI for your server, and has a nice plugin for us to manage Podman containers. It is admittedly limited in some respects, but uses Podman's REST API instead of the socket. I find this approach more modern and secure. Cockpit Installation Cockpit is not intended to be run as a container, but instead directly on the host. It can manage more than just Podman containers, but those are our focus today. Install directly on the host with: 1 sudo apt install cockpit cockpit-podman Once installed, we can start it and enable it at boot time with systemd: 1 sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket If you decide to access it only via host IP address on your local network, open port 9090 in your ufw firewall like we did above. Connect to Cockpit with https://your-server-ip:9090. Note that I have HTTPS in the address. This is due to the fact that, by default, Cockpit creates a self-signed TLS certificate. So you may get a security warning in your browser. Firefox Detected A Self-Signed Tls Certificate And Is Warning Us About It. It's safe to ignore, you can continue to use Cockpit. We Move Straight To The Login Screen. Note The Warning Sign On The Tls Lock. Access Cockpit Through Domain Name If you'd like to access it through a domain name, either externally and/or internally, we have to make one change to the system. As a protective measure, Cockpit doesn't normally allow anything (like reverse proxies) in front of it. But we can change that behavior by creating Cockpit configuration file on the system just like we have before. The configuration file is located at /etc/cockpit/cockpit.conf. Chances are this file does not exist yet, so we will create it and add the following: Hint: Remember the sudo -e command from before? 1 2 3 4 5 6 [WebService] # The domain name you'll be using goes here Origins = https://some.domain.com # Settings to ensure Cockpit works behind a reverse-proxy ProtocolHeader = X-Forwarded-Proto ForwardedForHeader = X-Forwarded-For Save and close. Restart Cockpit to enable the changes: 1 sudo systemctl restart cockpit.service Now we head back to Nginx Proxy Manager. Create a new Proxy Host. After entering your desired domain name, there are a few critical settings to pay attention to: Accessing Cockpit Via A Domain Name Includes Some Intricate Details. Scheme: The scheme must be set to https. This is due to Cockpit using self-signed certificates by default. If you are having trouble or would just like to use http, you will need to add AllowUnencrypted = true to the config file above. Forward Hostname / IP: We use the IP of the host. If we use localhost, or 127.0.0.1, Nginx Proxy Manager will not be able to find Cockpit. This is due to the way Podman creates and handles containers. Websockets Support: We must check this box for Cockpit to be accessible. Choose your SSL settings as Anand has described and save. You should now be able to reach Cockpit at the domain name you just set. Using Cockpit Login with your system credentials. On the left you will see lots of different sections with information about your system. You will also see a section called \"Podman containers\". Cockpit Has Many Features And Plugins, One Of Which Is For Podman! Here we can see images we've downloaded and both running and stopped containers. Clicking the arrow to the left of the container name allows us to see more details, logs, and instantly start a console in the container (if the container image supports it). While You Can't Do Everything Via Cockpit, There Are Some Nice Features. I will let you discover the rest of Cockpit's features. Check the documentation for more. Other monitoring tools Since I have left out Portainer, I wanted to mention some options you have if you're looking for more Podman dashboard information. Uptime-Kuma Uptime Kuma Can Be Used For A Quick Reference To See Your Container Status. A nice dashboard for monitoring container status. Grafana Grafana Is A Highly Customizable Visualization Tool. An infinitely customizable dashboard application that can take data from nearly any source and create a dashboard from it. Since we are talking Podman, here's an example of container stats. You will also need Promethus Podman Exporter to export stats from Podman to Prometheus database. Backends I decided to keep this section short and give just a single example for now. Perhaps later I will expand this section with other apps. Per usual, more can be found in the SmartHomeBeginner GitHub Repository. In your compose file, you might want to create a separator for each category of service; add a divider below your Nginx Proxy Manager if you'd like. 1 ######################## DASHBOARDS ################### I called mine Dashboards since this the next app on the list falls into the category. But you can name it anything you like, or follow Anand's naming scheme in the sister article. Heimdall Heimdall Is A Nice Visual Aid For Organizing Applications. As you'll probably add a ton of apps to your container stack, you might want a way to organize links to them in a visual dashboard. I find this especially useful for users who have a hard time remembering all of the URL's for different apps. Heimdall Podman Compose In your compose file, add the following to add the Heimdall dashboard to your stack: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 heimdall: <<: *common-keys-core # See EXTENSION FIELDS at the top image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall container_name: heimdall # We don't need to assign ports if we are accessing the apps through nginx proxy manager. If you want to access it via the server's IP, assign a port # ports: # - \"83:80\" # 80 to 82 already taken by other services # - \"444:443\" # 443 used by Nginx Proxy Manager. Disabled because we will put Heimdall behind proxy. volumes: - $DOCKERDIR/appdata/heimdall:/config environment: <<: *default-tz-puid-pgid Save and close the file. Start the container with the usual command: 1 podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d Add Heimdall to Nginx Proxy Manager Feel free to add Heimdall to Nginx Proxy Manager. Since the Heimdall container resides in the same npm_proxy network as Nginx Proxy Manager, it can be found by using http://heimdall:80. Warning: If your server is open to the internet, anyone fishing around could find your Heimdall dashboard! By default, there is no login or password. While not a huge security issue, by not setting any type of authentication, a bad actor can see whatever else you have running. I recommend limiting access to your local network, putting authorization and authentication in front of it, or using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) like Wireguard. At the bare minimum, set a password for your dashboard. RESTART CONTAINERS AND START ON BOOT Container restarts can be handled by Podman in much the same way Docker does. However the containers cannot be set to start on boot or after a reboot through Podman directly. Fortunately, as stated in my previous article, Systemd to the rescue! If you are unfamiliar with Systemd and how your server relates to it, I recommend reading up on it. There are numerous articles explaining how it works. The syntax and inner workings of a Systemd service can be complex. Systemd Is A Complex But Powerful System. Fortunately, Podman comes with a tool to generate these files for us using the commands and variables we used to create the container previously. So let's generate some Systemd unit files to have the system manage the containers at boot and restart as needed. Systemd Unit files The first thing we must consider is that we are running in a rootless environment. This means that we don't want to create Systemd files that require sudo to run. Fortunately, we can create Systemd unit files that can be run in our user space! No sudo required! Create our Systemd Userspace Directory By using Systemd as a user, the default location for Systemd service files is within our user's home directory. Normally this directory does not exist by default, so we need to create the directory where systemd will look for the configuration files. 1 2 mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user cd $_ Note: The command cd is used to change directory. The $_ after is used to reference the last directory we interacted with. In this case, $_ will represent /home/rairdev/.config/systemd/user. Generate the Systemd Files Now that we have created the directory, and are in the directory, let's have Podman generate the Systemd unit files for us: 1 podman generate systemd --new --name --files nginx-proxy-manager Note: podman generate systemd uses a default template to create basic Systemd files for us. The --new flag creates unit files that do not expect the container to already exist. Instead it will 'run' a new container each time. The --name flag means the unit file will refer to the container name, and not its ID. Otherwise you will have files called something like container-9c878a22406711922fdb480ed66af1056cf162a20d6d92ab248e83b94c9351b4.service. The --files flag means that the output will create a file instead of just outputting the result to your console. And finally we use the name of the container we want to create the Systemd unit file for. We can see that Podman has generated the Systemd files. Since I referenced a container, the Systemd unit file will be prefixed with \"container-\". Podman Adds 'Container-' To The Front Of Our Generated Filenames. Repeat this step for any further containers you wish to have start at boot. Restart Policy You may have noticed I did not mention anything about a restart policy! By default, when using the podman generate systemd command, Podman defaults to \"on-failure\". This is generally good for most circumstances. The other policy options are listed in the link above, although there's not a lot of info on exactly how each acts. If you'd like to set a different policy than the default, you can pass it as a command line option when generating the Systemd unit files: 1 podman generate systemd --restart-policy=always --new --name --files nginx-proxy-manager Note: By setting the restart policy to \"always\", the container will always try to restart. If you stop the container with podman stop, the container will restart itself via Systemd. If it is failing to start due to a bad configuration, it will be stuck in a continuous restart loop! Enable to Start on Boot Now that we have created the Systemd unit files, we simply need to enable them like we would any other service on our system. 1 systemctl --user enable --now container-nginx-proxy-manager Note: The critical piece here is the use of the --user flag. This allows even non-root users to create Systemd units. By using enable --now, we enable the container service at boot time, and start the Systemd unit now to use the restart policy you've set. And that's it! You're set. Checking Status, Updates, and Other Notes To check the status of your container's Systemd unit, the command is similar to nearly any other Systemd service: 1 systemctl --user status container-nginx-proxy-manager Systemd Is Taking Care Of Ensuring The Container Is Running Properly! Besides the usual podman ps -a command, we can also see which Systemd unit files have loaded correctly or failed: 1 systemctl --user list-units container\\* Our Units Are Loaded, Active, And Running! Note: By using container\\*, we are asking Systemd to show us any units that start with (match) the name \"container\". An asterisk is used to match \"anything\", but must be \"escaped\" by putting the backslash \"\\\" in front of it. Images With Version Tags If We Give An Image Version In Our Compose File Or Run Command, It Will Be Kept By Systemd. The last thing I wanted to mention is that if you are using version tags when running images, that version will be included in the Systemd unit file as shown above. Thus, if you update an app version in your compose file, you will need to re-generate the Systemd unit file. By running the same generate command as above, the new unit files will overwrite the old ones. Afterwards, you will need to tell Systemd to look for an updated service file: 1 systemctl --user daemon-reload There are more options available via Systemd (for example: container startup order) that you can read about in the Podman documentation. THINGS TO KNOW Linuxserver.io Images Linuxserver.io (LSIO) has spent a huge amount of time and resources building some amazing containers that prioritize simplicity and security. While these are much appreciated and necessary features in the Docker space, they have some characteristics that can be difficult to overcome using Podman. For example: In rootless Podman, the \"root\" user (UID and GID 0) are actually just our user on the host, not the host system root user. However, many of the LSIO images do not allow running them as the \"root\" user within the container. I tried multiple ways trying to setup Podman (v. 3.4.4) to play nice with LSIO images, but some just would not allow me to override the error caused by this security feature. It should be noted that some images do allow you to set the PUID and PGID environment variables to 0 without any issues. I have not tested many apps, but some work while others do not. YMMV. That being said, LSIO images can easily be used in Podman, but there is no official support for Podman. The main thing to be aware of is the files and directories you bind to the container will be owned by a user other than your own on the host. Depending on how you (or other containers) access these files, it may or may not be an issue for your setup. Create a System Group (Optional) If, for example, you want to share a directory across containers, and also access it as your user, we can create a system group and add our user to it. Assuming your user has an ID of 1000, and we have our PUID and PGID environmental variables set to 1000, files created by these images will be owned by user 100999 (see above for a more in-depth explanation). 1 2 sudo addgroup --gid 100999 media sudo usermod -aG media rairdev Note: The first command is adding a group to our system called \"media\" with the group ID of 100999. The second command is to add the group named \"media\" to our user's (rairdev) list of groups. And now when I look at the files used by LSIO containers, I can open and modify them as long as they have permissions set for the group. Adding A Group Simplifies Access. Note: If a file or directory is giving \"Permission Denied\" errors, you can still access and edit them using the podman unshare command discussed above. Portainer for Podman I know many of you rely heavily on Portainer to manage your containers and view their status. I did not include it as one of the apps above for two reasons. 1. We Must Create and Expose a Podman Socket This isn't ultimately that big of a deal as the socket has good permissions and only allows our user access to it. I just have a hard time exposing such a powerful feature to a piece of software under heavy development. Maybe I just have trust issues. 2. Only Partial Podman Support After nearly 2 years of people requesting Podman support, users finally got their wish - well sort of. Portainer does work with Podman, but many features are missing and I personally found the experience to be less than stellar. It does appear, however, that the Portainer team is slowly building support for Podman. Keep an eye on this GitHub issue which is tracking the current support for Podman. How do I Use Portainer with Podman? I don't care about your trust issues; how do I use Portainer with Podman anyways! For those of you insisting on continuing to use Portainer, the instructions for using it with Podman can be found in this post on their GitHub. Make sure to pay attention to use the \"Rootless\" section. How do I Use an Updated Version of Podman? As of writing, Podman in Ubuntu repositories is at version 3.4.4. I find this odd as there have been 3 security releases since then and it should be at least at 3.4.7. The official Podman documentation does a good job of explaining how to install updated versions of Podman. It involves adding some repositories from Kubic. Unfortuantely, the \"testing\" repo is very far behind at version 3.4.2. However, if you're willing to live on the bleeding edge, \"unstable\" has just released the most updated version of Podman - 4.3.0. Can Podman Auto-update My Containers? Yes! A popular container to run with Docker called Watchtower can automatically update containers for you when new versions are pushed to a repository. Podman can also do this via Systemd. The documentation does a good job of covering the auto-update process, but I will give you an example using podman-compose. Open your compose file. Under any service we want auto-updated, we need to add a label. For example I will add one to my Heimdall container: 1 2 3 4 5 6 heimdall: ... environment: <<: *default-tz-puid-pgid labels: - \"io.containers.autoupdate=registry\" Note: You could also add this to an extensions field if you'd like to enable auto-updates to multiple services quickly. After adding this to your compose file, you will have to: Destroy the old container, recreate it, regenerate the Systemd unit file, and re-enable the Systemd unit file as described above. Testing Podman Container Auto Update Once you've accomplished that, try out a \"dry-run\" 1 podman auto-update --dry-run The Final Column Shows Us The Status Of Auto-Update. If everything works as expected, you should see the above. Note the \"UPDATED\" column. If it reads \"pending\", there is an update available but it hasn't been applied yet. Removing the --dry-run flag will update the container for you and restart it. When completed, the final column should now read \"true\". If the container fails to start for some reason, the default behavior is for podman to rollback the container to the previously working version. Auto Updating Podman Containers on Schedule If you'd like your containers to auto-update themselves on a schedule, you have 2 options: the built-in systemd unit, or you can add this command to a cron job. I'll let you discover the latter. To use the built-in systemd unit, we simply need to enable it. This unit, by default, relies on a systemd timer to run everyday at midnight and update your containers. Enable it with: 1 systemctl --user enable --now podman-auto-update.service To modify the time the unit runs or how frequently, you can edit the systemd timer files located in /usr/lib/systemd/user/podman-auto-update.timer. Better yet, before editing the files, make a copy of them into your user's .config directory we created earlier to ensure they aren't affected by updates! Are you considering switching from Docker to Podman? Yes No I do not know View Results CONCLUDING REMARKS While Podman is billed as a \"direct drop-in replacement\" for Docker, there are still some steps involved on getting Podman to behave as expected on non-Red Hat based operating systems. I know it's taken some work to get there, but hopefully this Podman How-to has taken some of the mystery out of switching from Docker to Podman. Podman is also updated regularly (although not in Ubuntu's repos) to become more and more in parity with Docker. Podman-compose has also come a long way and is constantly under development to act in a predictable manner while providing compatibility with docker-compose. These two tools took some getting used to since they are somewhat different than Docker. But as the development continues, I see Podman continuing to improve and proving easier and easier for users to migrate to. After using Podman exclusively for well over a year, I can say that it is challenging at times, but rewarding overall. If you feel energized and want to challenge yourself, you can take our Docker Traefik guide and adapt it for Podman. Thank you, reader, for taking the time to follow along this guide on replacing Docker with Podman.

After configuration, your Docker tools are directed to use a Podman engine and your Compose applications can be run using the Podman CLI. As a developer, you can: Check the system socket mapping status to know whether the socket is reachable. The default socket path is: /var/run/docker.sock on macOS and Linux npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine on Windows Use all Docker tools, including CLI, with the Podman engine without any reconfiguration. These tools connect to the default Podman socket, thereby enabling you to use all Docker commands with Podman. For example, you can run the docker run command on the Podman engine to start a container. On macOS, the Third-Party Docker Tool Compatibility setting is enabled by default. On Windows and Linux, the Third-Party Docker Tool Compatibility setting is not available. You can use the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to let your tools communicate directly with the Podman socket. Use the Podman CLI to run Compose applications by installing and setting up the Compose extension. For example, you can run the docker compose up command on the Podman engine to start your Compose v2 application. Also, ensure to place your Docker Compose file in a working directory, such as your home directory. If the Compose CLI is not installed, you get the install option in the settings. Select and use a Docker-compatible socket context. You can also view the socket details, such as name and socket path. Prerequisites A running Podman machine. Windows macOS Linux Procedure Go to Settings > Docker Compatibility. System socket status setting: View the socket mapping status to check whether the socket is reachable. Docker CLI Context setting: Select a socket context to work with from the dropdown list. Podman Compose CLI Support setting: Check whether the Podman Compose CLI is supported. If not, use the Setup... button to install and set up the CLI. Verification Run podman or podman compose commands for your Compose applications to check if they run fine.

In this article, I use real-world examples to show you how to install Podman, use its basic commands, and transition from the Docker command-line interface (CLI) to Podman. You'll also see how to run an existing image with Podman and how to set up port forwarding. What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux-native tool designed to develop, manage, and run Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and pods. Being daemonless means Podman does not use a long-running background process (a daemon) unlike Docker, which contributes to its increased security and lightweight design. It also has a similar structure to similar tools such as Buildah, Skopeo, and CRI-O. Install Podman Head to the official documentation to learn how to install Podman for your machine. For example, if you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9), enter the command: $ dnf -y install podman You may be using yum, if so replace yum with dnf. If Linux is unavailable, you can use Podman Desktop for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Using the Podman CLI One of Podman's greatest advantages is its CLI compatibility with Docker. In fact, when building Podman, Docker users can adapt without any significant changes. For example, you can use the alias command to create a docker alias for Podman: $ alias docker=podman You can run familiar commands, such as pull, push, build, commit, tag, and more with Podman. You can also use Podman to run secure, rootless containers. By joining a user namespace and setting root access inside, you can enable Podman to mount certain filesystems and set up the container with no escalation of privileges. Run an existing image using Podman Fortunately, images created by Docker and Podman are compatible with the OCI standard. This means that Podman can push and pull from container registries such as the Docker Hub and Quay.io. For example, let's test the Funbox container, which combines terminal commands and ASCII art. To start, clone the repository in a local directory with the following git commands: $ git clone https://github.com/wernight/docker-funbox.git Once you download the necessary files, you can pull the base image and additional requirements to build and run a container: $ podman run --rm -it wernight/funbox In this case, we've used the following tags with the podman run command: The --rm tag removes the container after it exits. The -it tag connects the container to the terminal so that you can interact with it. We now have a container active and running (mine is running on top of Debian Jessie). Let's add an argument to view the Funbox in action: $ podman run --rm -it wernight/funbox nyancat Figure 1: Nyan Cat in terminal from running container. If you see a Nyan Cat displayed on your console screen, you are all set to deploy and interact with a container using Podman. Running and setting up a container with Podman Dozens of base images are available to download and use with Podman. For this example, let's set up a simple Apache HTTP Server 2.4 in a CentOS container. To begin, pull the base image you want to use from the Docker Hub: $ podman pull centos:latest Once you've created the base image, use podman images to check whether the container is ready to use. You should see output similar to what's shown in Figure 2: Figure 2: The container is ready to use To run the new container with your base image, use the podman run command with specific tags (such as -it) to attach it to the CLI. Use --name to define a custom name. Finally, define the base image where the container should run: $ podman run -it --name redhat-website centos:latest When the container is running, automatically set root access inside to run all commands. Create the Apache HTTP server To create an Apache web server, we can install the httpd program with the default package installer. For CentOS, it's yum: $ yum install -y httpd The following image shows the container running and installation of httpd. Figure 3: Console output for the yum install command. You can now serve content from your container to your server's public IP address. Create a web page Next, we will add text to an index.html file in the container's var/www/html directory. Feel free to customize your message, or add the default below: $ echo 'Hello from Red Hat!' > /var/www/html/index.html When you are finished, type exit to shut down or power off the container. Use podman commit to commit your changes. Use tags to define a name and a custom version for your customized container: $ podman commit redhat-website redhat-website:v1 Finally, launch the container, then forward all requests made to your server's public IP address on port 8080 to port 80 on the container. Use the Podman tag -p to port forward, and specify the container that you want to run. Ensure that httpd is running as a foreground process: $ podman run -p 8080:80 redhat-website:v1 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND To view the web page from the host device, run a curl command while specifying port 8080. You should see the screen shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: A successful example of port forwarding using Podman. How to stop and remove a container You can use the podman stop command to stop a specified container: $ podman stop redhat-website Use podman rm to remove the container: $ podman rm redhat-website Conclusion Every command that I demonstrated in this article is compatible with the Docker CLI. Podman also has great integration features through systemd. You can use it to run rootless containers, and it is a powerful tool for running OCI containers on RHEL, and whatever your system may be. You can continue to experiment with Podman by setting up this lab, which offers an interactive environment directly in your browser where you can containerize your application with Buildah and Podman. If you need container orchestration, you can use Podman with Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift. To get started with these platforms, see kubernetesbyexample.com and developers.redhat.com/learn.

Are there any limitations compared to Docker Build? Is Podman faster than Docker? Conclusion Why Use Podman Build from Dockerfiles? Podman is a lightweight and secure alternative to Docker, but at the same time, there must be minimal changes and compatibility needed for an easy transition between Podman and Docker. Let’s explore the key advantages of using Podman build from Dockerfile: Podman Build from Dockerfiles Benefits Reusable Workflow: Podman provides out-of-the-box support for the Docker Ecosystem. Podman is compatible with the Dockerfile, you don’t have to modify syntax or structure. This allows you to use the existing Dockerfile without changing your workflow and CI/CD process. Reusable workflow saves time and effort when you move from Docker to Podman. Podman vs Docker: Choose the Right One Lightweight & Efficient: Docker and Podman follow different architectures. Podman utilizes the daemon-less architecture opposite Docker, which operates the centrally managed Docker daemon to manage the containers. This means the Docker daemon should be running to keep the container running. By default, if the Docker daemon crashes it terminates all the running containers due to its daemon-based architecture. Podman daemon-less design is more efficient for resource usage and makes it lightweight compared to Docker. Security-Focused: Both Podman and Docker implemented the rootless mode for running containers. Podman runs the container as a non-root user by default, provides the native integration with SELinux, and secures default settings. Running applications inside the container will not protect against crucial security vulnerabilities but using Podman provides the best default security settings to harden the containerized environment. Flexibility: Podman and Docker can be used as a standalone container management platform. Switching between them is quick and easy, thanks to Podman, which provides identical CLI and management similar to Docker. This provides the flexibility for choosing the tools that suit your project without worrying about interoperability.

Getting Started with Podman Build from Dockerfile Now you know the benefits of Podman build from Dockerfile, let’s check the steps for using it with the Podman. Prerequisites: Before starting, ensure you have the latest Podman installed on your system. If you need help with Podman installation you can check the official Podman documentation for the specific instruction. https://podman.io/docs/installation If you want to build the Podman from the source you can check the below guide: Build Podman from Source: 5 Easy Steps Dockerfile vs Containerfile Dockerfile is native to the Docker ecosystem and, a term used with Docker that is platform-specific. Cloud Native Computing Foundation – CNFC defines the standard naming for the containerization application called the Containerfile, this is more generic and standard for platforms other than Docker. Essentially, Containerfile use the identical syntax as Dockerfile. With Podman you can use a filename either Containerfile or Dockerfile. Basic Podman Build Command: The command for building and image with Podman is podman build Bash podman build [OPTIONS] <context> [--tag <image_name>:<tag>] Let’s understand the command: podman build: This will start the build process with Podman [OPTIONS]: You can specify the various options for the build process. <context>: By default, the current directory is the context directory. You can specify the other than current. [--tag]: Optional but you can tag the specific version for better management. For example, you can build the below Dockerfile for the simple Python app: Dockerfile # Use Python as base for Podman Build from Dockerfiles FROM python:3.9 # Set the working directory in the container WORKDIR /app # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app COPY . /app # Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container EXPOSE 80 # Define environment variable ENV NAME World # Run app.py when the container launches CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"] if your Dockerfile is inside the directory named “podman-build-dockerfile”, you can run the below command to build the image: Bash podman build -t python-app:latest . You can verify the tagged image: Bash podman image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE python 3.9 b3ff343f73ed 3 days ago 876MB python-app latest 8fce1de157c7 1 days ago 978MB Specifying Dockerfile Location: You can specify the Dockerfile location with the context argument in the podman build command using the -f option: Bash podman build -f /path/to/Dockerfile If you don’t specify the explicit context directory and -f the option is used, Podman will use the parent directory of the Dockerfile as build context.

With this cheat sheet, you’ll get exactly what you need, right when you need it. Get the Cheat Sheet (FREE Access!) Podman Build from Dockerfile: Advanced Options Podman provides advanced options for building your container images: Multi-Stage Builds: Multi-stage builds are a powerful method for smaller and more efficient container images. You need to define the two or more Dockerfile: Build Stage: You should build your application in this stage, installing dependencies and building the application binary or assets. Runtime Stage: Since you build your application in the build stage, you can use the minimal image such as alpine and run the binary. Separating the build into multiple stages can reduce the final Docker image size and have a smaller footprint. Dockerfile # Build Stage FROM node:18-alpine AS builder WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm install COPY . . RUN npm run build # Runtime Stage FROM nginx:alpine COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html EXPOSE 80 CMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"] In this example: The first section defines the build stage with the Node.js environment and builds the application The second section defines the runtime stage that takes reference from the “builder” Copy the build artifact to the nginx directory Let’s Podman build with Dockerfiles for multi-stage applications: Bash podman build -f Dockerfile -t multi-stg:latest Once your Podman image is ready you can run with podman run and verify with Podman attaching to the running container. Building from Remote URLs, Git, or archive: Podman supports building the images from the remote Dockerfile or Containerfile. You can use your remote Git environment or HTTP(S) URLs for building with Podman. When you use the remote location, Podman will download the file or repository to a temporary location and use that as a build context. Podman build from Dockerfiles from the HTTP(S) URL: Podman downloads the file to the temporary temporary location and uses it as a build context Bash podman build https://192.168.0.12/podman-remote/Containerfile Podman build from Dockerfiles from the remote Git repository: Podman clones the Git repository to the temporary location and uses it as a build context. Bash podman build -t podman-build-with-dockerfile https://github.com/containers/PodmanHello.git podman run podman-build-with-dockerfile Podman build from Dockerfiles from the URL archive: Podman downloads the archive from the mentioned URL, decompresses it, and uses it as build context. Bash podman build -f prod/Containerfile https://192.168.0.12/podman-remote/context.tar.gz Note: Podman supports xz, bzip2, gzip and identity format for the compression. FAQs – Podman Build with Dockerfiles Will Podman work with all Dockerfiles? Yes, Podman understands the Dockerfile and syntax and allows you to reuse your Dockerfile without modification. Are there any limitations compared to Docker Build? Podman can’t support Docker Swarm builds, remote management, and a less mature ecosystem compared to Docker. However, the Podman build is compatible with the Dockerfile format. Is Podman faster than Docker? The performance difference is relatively small. Podman may have an advantage in for resource usage but Docker is more efficient in container creation and management. Conclusion You can use Docker and Podman in your project based on your requirements. Podman provides the support for your existing Dockerfile, you can transition from Docker to Podman without major modifications to your workflow. Podman support for the Docker syntax allows you to use the same Dockerfile without rewriting running as the standalone container or use Docker compose with Podman.

The basic principles of the Podman runtime environment is only compatible with Linux operating systems. You can, however, manage containers on the Podman-running machine using a remote client for another operating system. What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless, open-source, Linux-native tool that makes it simple to identify, execute, build, share, and deploy applications that use Open Containers Initiative (OCI) containers and container images. Podman features a command line interface (CLI) that is familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can just alias Docker to Podman without issue. Containers run by Podman can be either root or a non-privileged user. Podman manages the complete container ecosystem, including pods, containers, container images, and container volumes, with the libpod library. Why Use Podman With Dockerfiles? Flexibility: Podman and Docker can function as standalone container management platforms. Switching between them is quick and simple owing to Podman, which has the same CLI and administrative interface as Docker. Security-Focused: Both Podman and Docker support the rootless option for operating containers. Podman operates the container as a non-root user by default, integrates natively with SELinux, and secures default settings. Lightweight & Efficient: Docker and Podman have distinct architectures that prioritize lightweight and efficiency. Podman has a daemon-less architecture, as opposed to Docker, which manages containers via a centrally managed Docker daemon. Implementation of Podman: A Basic Example of Using Podman With Dockerfiles Below is the step-by-step process of using Podman with Dockerfiles: Step 1: Install Podman First of all, Your package manager ought to display messages confirming the successful installation of Podman. $ sudo apt install podman Output: Step 2: Make a Dockerfile Now let's make a basic Dockerfile. We'll construct a container that runs a rudimentary Nginx web server in this example. # Use an official Nginx image as a parent image FROM nginx:alpine # Copy a custom configuration file (if needed) # COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf # Expose port 80 for the web server EXPOSE 80 Step 3: Create the Container Image To create the container image, navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located and execute the Podman command as follows. $ podman build -t my-nginx-image Output: Step 4: Run the Container The container ID will appear when you perform the podman run command. $ podman run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx-container my-nginx-image Output: Step 5: Check the Container Next, You can use the following to see how your container is running. $ podman ps Output: Step 6: Remove the Container In the next step, you can remove the container by using the following command. $ podman rm my-nginx-container Output: Step 7: Remove the Image Lastly, Use these if you need to remove the image. $ podman rmi my-nginx-image Output: Best Practices of Podman With Dockerfiles Use Namespaces and Cgroups: Podman facilitates resource allocation and security by supporting user namespaces and groups. Make sure you're making use of these features to improve control and isolation. Use Podman Pods for Grouping Containers: Form a Pod from of connected containers. This makes management easier and enables them to share network namespaces. Keep Images Minimal and Singularly Focused: Podman With Dockerfiles are typically used for stateless microservices that are designed to be scaled horizontally. This means that several container instances of the same Docker image will frequently run concurrently and need to be launched fast at random. Use ENV to Create Environment Variables: Environment variables are useful for passing information to your applications that can change at runtime. This frequently includes paths to executables that your script will use, package version numbers, and API keys. Conclusion In this article, we have learned about Podman: A Basic Example of Using Podman With Dockerfiles. Since Podman and Dockerfiles are interoperable, most Docker commands will function identically in Podman. Podman: A Basic Example of Using Podman With Dockerfiles - FAQs What is the use of Podman build? Podman Build Creates an image with instructions from one or more Containerfiles or Dockerfiles and a given build context directory. A Containerfile follows the same syntax as a Dockerfile Where are Podman containers? When Podman is launched as the root user, pictures are automatically saved to the /var/lib/containers directory. Standard users commonly save photos at $HOME/.local/share/containers/storage/. Where are Podman secrets stored? If a fully qualified path is provided, the secret is installed at that location. Otherwise, the secret is mounted in /run/secrets/target. If the target is not specified, the secret will be mounted to /run/secrets/secretname by default. Does Podman need virtualization? Each Podman computer on Windows runs a virtualized Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSLv2) distribution.

But CNCF the Cloud Native Computing Foundation had standardized the name to Containerfile. Containerfile is more generic, and this decision was because apart from Docker, there are other container solutions as well like Podman. when we are building Dockerfiles we should know a little bit about parent- child image. A child image is an image that is created from a parent image and incorporates everything in the parent images. On such example is, if we want to build an image for database application, the image built will be based on MariaDB or MySQL. In this case MariaDB or MySQL is the parent image and the image which we have created for our application will be the child image, which includes everything from the parent image in a different layer. Starting from a parent image makes it a lot easier to create a reliable image Also Read: Podman: Understanding Container Images and Containers Registries . Creating Dockerfile for podman image building Docker file starts with FROM, which identifies the base image to use. Instructions to be executed on that base image is written after the base image declaration The order of instruction in the Dockerfile matters, as the order of execution of the instruction is from top to bottom Each Docker file instruction runs in an independent container, using an intermediate image built from a previous command, which means that adding multiple instructions results in multiple layers As a generic rule of thumbs, the number on the layers on the image should be minimal Each project will have its own project Directory, where we will be creating the Dockerfile and its dependent requirement in that directory. For this exercise we have created a directory called podman_tut. Inside the directory i have my docker file and one other dependent file which i want to place in my image Below code snippet shows the directory content and the dockerfile content [root@localhost podman_tut]# pwd /root/podman_tut [root@localhost podman_tut]# ll total 4 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 205 Feb 11 15:27 Dockerfile -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Feb 11 15:23 sample_file.repo [root@localhost podman_tut]# cat Dockerfile FROM ubi MAINTAINER Admin <admin@linuxdatahub.com> #Add file from local ADD ./sample_file.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/ #Install extra rpms required RUN yum -y install bash nmap && \\ yum clean all ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\"] #CMD From the docker file it can be seen that the docker file starts by defining a base image by using keyword \"FROM\". In our case, we will be using ubi image We are using MAINTAINER keyword to specific the details of the maintainer and their email address ADD keyword is used to add a fie from local machine/project directory (current directory) to the a path in the image. In our case we are placing a repo file \"sample_file.repo\" to /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory of the image RUN command can be used to run other bash commands in the image. In our case we are using yum to install rpms ENTRYPOINT defines the default command that will be running on the container. CMD keyword is used to add argument to the ENTRYPOINT command, in our case we are not having any arguments so it left commented Podman Build Image from Dockerfile Podman image building with Dockerfile can be done by executing podman build .

To maintain readability, write the commands on different lines used && \\ at the end of each line. RUN yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=\"myrepo\" && \\ yum update -y && \\ yum install nmap Clean yum caches and remove documenation When installing software from a Dockerfile, use dnf clean all -y to clean yum caches. Exclude documentation as well as unnecessary dependencies from the container image. We can use --nodocs for no documentation and --setopt install_weak_deps=False, that works with dnf install, and it makes sure that the number of dependencies installed will be minimized RUN dnf install -y httpd --nodocs --setopt install_weak_deps=False Base image Selection While selection base image for FROM dockerfile instruction, use a minimal base image, if we are planning to use ubi image, instead of using regular ubi image, use ubi-minimal Search on LinuxDataHub Search for: Leave a Comment Comment Name Email Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

June 17, 2022Matthew Heon3-minute read Containers Application development and delivery SHARE SUBSCRIBE Back to all posts While Kubernetes has grown to dominate container orchestration, there is still substantial interest in managing containers on a smaller scale, usually for a single system. For these cases, the tool of choice for many years has been Docker Compose. In the Podman project, we are frequently asked questions about Docker Compose. Does Podman support Docker Compose? What about Docker Compose v2? What is Podman Compose, and should I use it instead of Docker Compose? Read on to find answers to these questions and details on the Podman team's view of the future. The history of Docker Compose and Podman Compose Docker Compose began in 2014 as a project to manage groups of containers based on YAML definitions. This YAML was later given a formal specification, the Compose spec. This specification defines a structured language allowing you to run multiple containers on a single machine easily. This single-file definition of multiple containers is an alternative to running these containers directly from the command line. Docker Compose was written in Python and communicated with the Docker daemon using its REST API. When Podman was released in 2018, we focused entirely on compatibility with the Docker command-line interface (CLI) and did not include support for the API. Therefore, Podman initially could not be used with Docker Compose. Many people wanted to use Podman and keep their existing Compose YAML files, so a community project called Podman Compose sprung up. Podman Compose processes the Compose spec and translates it into Podman CLI commands. However, Podman Compose is not perfect because it implements a subset of the functionality of Docker Compose. Many users wish to continue using Docker Compose and other tools that directly connect to the Docker API. To satisfy our community and customers, Podman added a Docker-compatible API in 2019, but supporting Docker Compose required additional work, which occurred in 2020. [ Get to know Podman by downloading the free Podman basics cheat sheet. ] The Docker Compose project had also not been idle. In 2021, the Docker Compose project unveiled a complete rewrite of the tool in Go, called Docker Compose v2.0 (older, v1.x versions are often called docker-compose, while v2.x are called docker compose). The rewrite required additional effort to work with Podman, arriving in Podman v4.1 in 2022 (though support for the Buildkit API is still pending). Which should you use? This still does not answer most people's question: Should I use Podman Compose or Docker Compose? Neither project is affiliated with Podman (Podman Compose is a community project, not directly maintained by the Podman team). Both are supported for use with Podman, and the Podman team will fix any bugs in Podman that prevent their use (though bugs in the tools themselves will need to be fixed there). Podman Compose is better integrated with Podman (as it was designed from the ground up to work with Podman) and makes better use of rootless containers and pods. However, Docker Compose is the more featureful option, being the reference implementation of Compose. As such, the answer to which you should use is \"it depends.\" [ Getting started with containers? Check out this free course. Deploying containerized applications: A technical overview. ] Podman Compose is the more native and lightweight solution. Podman Compose executes the Podman command directly, rather than communicating with Podman's API socket. This eliminates the need to run the Podman service to provide the API, saving resources. Because it uses Podman's regular command line and fork-exec model, it is easier to trace and manage on the system. For example, Podman Compose can easily be managed by a systemd unit file. Docker Compose has more features. It is compatible with Docker and Podman and, therefore, more versatile. Further, it has more users than Podman Compose, is more widely tested, and likely more stable. Given that there are valid reasons to use both, Podman is committed to supporting both Docker Compose and Podman Compose, including both major versions of Docker Compose. The future of Podman and Compose The Podman team is not focused on Compose YAML. Instead, we are hard at work on podman generate kube and podman play kube, which allow Kubernetes YAML to be used directly with Podman in a manner similar to Compose. With these tools, we have the advantage of integration with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. For example, containers that run on Podman via podman play kube can be easily moved onto an OpenShift (Kubernetes) cluster, or a developer can run a pod that misbehaves in Kubernetes on their laptop to debug issues using podman play kube. We feel that this integration between Podman and Kubernetes is a powerful combination, and it is what we are focusing our efforts on. At the same time, we recognize that most people are using Compose now and will continue to do so for many years. However, we hope users will choose to convert to podman play kube, perhaps using guides such as From Docker Compose to Kubernetes with Podman. We will support both Docker Compose and Podman Compose with Podman for the foreseeable future.

Last Updated : 12 Jul, 2024 Podman and Docker Compose are two tools with related functions concerning the operation of containers but each satisfies a different role in the container taxonomy. Podman is a container engine to collects, operates, manages, and runs containerized applications without a daemon, which is more secure and has no daemon problem than Docker. While Docker Compose is a dedicated tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, docker-compose is a YAML file that can specify application services. It is thus crucial for developers and DevOps specialists to acquaint themselves with what Podman and Docker Compose offer and what is distinctive with one another to make the right selections with regards to the application of the tools in terms of security, ease of use aspects, and orchestration. What is Podman Compose? Podman Compose is a command line tool used to create and manage applications that consist of multiple containers by using Podman, which is an unauthorized container engine with a daemon. It is like Docker Compose but on top of Podman instead of Docker. Podman Compose is based on YAML files that contain descriptions of the necessary services, networks, and volumes of a multi-service application; thus, the users can control the applications and their environment with ease and with predictable results. It serves as a translation layer where users, who are acquainted with Docker Compose, get the ability to use Podman while incurring minimal changes to the Compose files. Features of Podman Compose Daemonless Operation: Party-sized instances that do not have a background daemon making them relatively more secure and requiring fewer system resources. Rootless Containers: Apprecates the ability to run a container as an ordinary user as opposed to root; it minimizes the chances of someone getting root permissions. Compatibility: Respects Docker Compose YAML files which makes it easier for users of Docker who are transitioning to Podman. Integrated with Systemd: May create systemd service files which will help in managing the containers like system services. Kubernetes Support: Embodies abilities to create Kubernetes YAML files from Docker Compose files helpful in the launching to Kubernetes clusters. What is Docker Compose? Docker Compose is an efficient tool that enables users to maintain and describe applications with more than one container using Docker. Docker Compose provides flexibility in coding specific services, networks, and volumes that are required for an application using a YAML file making it possible to set up complex environments for the applications easily. It brings efficiency in the act of the deployment of several components of an application, particularly because it can check that the various parts of a complex application start up in the correct sequence and are properly interlinked. Docker compose is especially important in the development, testing and staging environment where mirroring the production environment is critical. Features of Docker Compose Multi-Container Deployment: A really powerful tool in orchestration as it defines and runs multiple Docker containers in a single command and through that, it simplifies the whole process of managing a complex application. Service Management: Enables the manipulation of the services within a system which includes multiple containers like the ability to start, stop or restart a specific service. Environment Configuration: It supports defining the environment variables, command-line arguments, and settings in the YAML file. Network Isolation: Automatically create and manage the network for the containers’ communication to provide an isolated as well as secure network. Volume Management: Describes the block storage devices and attaches them to containers to provide containers with a durable storage space and retain data even when a container has been restarted. Difference between Podman and Docker Compose Parameter Podman Compose Docker Compose Daemon Daemonless, no background service required Requires a background Docker daemon Rootless Operation Supports rootless containers Rootless operation is more complex and limited Security Higher security due to lack of a centralized daemon Relies on a central daemon, which can be a security risk Command Line Interface CLI commands are similar to Docker Uses docker-compose command for orchestration Configuration Files Uses Docker Compose YAML files for compatibility Uses docker-compose.yml for configuration System Integration Can generate systemd service files No built-in support for generating systemd files Kubernetes Support Can generate Kubernetes YAML files No direct support for generating Kubernetes files Installation Typically lighter due to no daemon Requires Docker daemon installation Networking Handles networking similarly but with rootless mode advantages Standard Docker networking with the daemon Performance Often more efficient without daemon overhead May have additional overhead due to daemon Compatibility Compatible with Docker CLI commands Specific to Docker ecosystem Orchestration Can be used with tools like Podman Compose Uses Docker Compose for orchestration Platform Support Linux, with limited support on Windows and macOS Cross-platform support, fully functional on Linux, Windows, and macOS Applications of Podman Compose Development Environments: Formerly applied to build dev/testing environments that may not need root privileges and provide more security and flexibility to developers. CI/CD Pipelines: Embedded in CI/CD processes to construct, test and release secure applications to the production environment. Containerized Applications: Containerized applications can be deployed as well as managed within a production environment, this is backed by Podman which is a daemonless environment to enhance security. Microservices Architecture: It is involved in managing microservices deployments by using rootless containers, hence minimizing the exposure to higher privileges. Systemd Integration: It creates systemd service files to make containerized applications or applications running inside containers act as services and start along with the boot and are manageable. Applications of Docker Compose Multi-Container Applications: Batch defines container(s) for an application and its dependent components and manages the lifecycle and interconnectivity of such containers during the development and usage of applications. Testing Environments: Building test isolation mechanisms to have equivalent test conditions that will produce consistent and comparable results. Local Development: Creates local development environments identical to production systems helping the developers to be in touch with real environment. Service Management: Handles and manages individual services where multiple containers are making it easy to manage and scale in case of high load. Continuous Integration: In CI pipelines create isolated application stacks for the Integration Test to be sure that the application under test works correctly when all the services are deployed and running. Conclusion In conclusion, both Podman and Docker Compose are great tools when it comes to the management of containers as they both have their pros and cons. Podman, being daemonless and rootless, focuses on security and optimal usage of resources and hence, it becomes ideal in secured environments. On the other hand, Docker Compose is optimally used to coordinate multiple container applications effectively and promises a comprehensive solution for development, testing and live environments. By knowing the strengths and the area of application of each tool, the users will be in a position to select the right tool for the job and increase the flexibility as well as security of the containerized applications. Podman and Docker Compose - FAQs Can I use Podman on Windows? Podman is normally for Linux but, there is an ability to use it on Windows using WSL. All the features of Podman are fully supported in native Linux systems and therefore they are most applicable there. Is Docker Compose compatible with Kubernetes? While Docker Compose is not compatible with Kubernetes out of the box, there are interfaces such as Kompose that translate a Docker Compose file into Kubernetes files for easy deployment to the Kubernetes clusters. How do I migrate from Docker to Podman? Docker can smoothly be replaced by Podman because there is CLI compatibility. The majority of docker commands function in Postman, and Postman can understand docker-compose YAML and files for docker-compose to help the transition. Can I run Podman and Docker simultaneously? Yes, Podman and Docker do not interfere with the operations of one another and can both be run on the same operating system. Unlike Docker, Podman does not run a daemon, this means users and system administrators can use both Docker and Podman if they wish. Does Docker Compose support secret management? Yes, Docker Compose allows for the management of secrets. Secrets can be described in the docker-compose. yml file and kept it secured so that the sensitive data can be passed to the containers avoiding its exposure on the environment variables.

These applications usually consists of multiple inter-connecting parts. For example, the main application interacting with a database to store, read and write data. To make the experience of setting up databases, developers also provide ways to bring them up automatically. One of the most used and well-known ways of doing this is to provide a Docker compose configuration for the application and its required services. What is Docker Compose? Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.1 How does a Docker Compose configuration look like? version: \"3.9\" # optional since v1.27.0 services: web: build: . ports: - \"8000:5000\" volumes: - .:/code - logvolume01:/var/log depends_on: - redis redis: image: redis volumes: logvolume01: {} While in the same directory as this configuration file (named: docker-compose.yaml), you can bring up these applications by executing: $ docker-compose up -d When podman came out, there was a tool created later on called podman-compose to help ease transition from docker & docker-compose. What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless, open source, Linux native tool designed to make it easy to find, run, build, share and deploy applications using Open Containers Initiative (OCI) Containers and Container Images. Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.2 As mentioned above, podman was easily usable for people already familiar with docker without having to re-learn all the command arguments. I have used podman-compose before, however, while looking at an application recently, I wanted to learn to use the more native solution with podman. Thus, learning about how I could make use of podman pod. What is a Pod? A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod’s contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific “logical host”: it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host. A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.3 Looking again at the example Compose configuration, you will notice that the port from the container 5000 is forwarded to the host’s port, i.e., 8000, meaning ports in Docker are mapped from containers. This is also true for normal containers in Podman as well. However, things work differently in a pod, as stated above about a Pod. Therefore, for a pod the port is mapped from it, rather than from a container directly. Thus, when you create a pod you also declare the port(s) you want to map to your host. To understand this better, let’s look at the application I used: miniflux - a minimalist and opinionated feed reader, to convert their provided docker installation method in docker-compose to using Podman pods. The Docker compose configuration for miniflux could look like below: version: '3.4' services: miniflux: image: miniflux/miniflux:latest ports: - \"80:8080\" depends_on: - db environment: - DATABASE_URL=postgres://miniflux:secret@db/miniflux?sslmode=disable - RUN_MIGRATIONS=1 - CREATE_ADMIN=1 - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin - ADMIN_PASSWORD=test123 healthcheck: test: [\"CMD\", \"/usr/bin/miniflux\", \"-healthcheck\", \"auto\"] db: image: postgres:latest environment: - POSTGRES_USER=miniflux - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret volumes: - miniflux-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data healthcheck: test: [\"CMD\", \"pg_isready\", \"-U\", \"miniflux\"] interval: 10s start_period: 30s volumes: miniflux-db: Breaking it down, you will notice that there are 2 containers: the application: miniflux/miniflux the postgres database: postgres This means we will have to pull the 2 images to our local registry: $ podman pull ghcr.io/miniflux/miniflux:latest $ podman pull docker.io/library/postgres:latest The only port mapped is 8080 from the miniflux container to port 80 on the host. Therefore, creating a pod would be: $ podman pod create --name minifluxapp -p 80:8080 You will also notice that the postgres container uses a named volume, we will replicate that in podman by: $ podman volume create miniflux-db Since the miniflux container depends on db, we will first create the db container inside the pod as follows: $ podman run --name=db -d --restart always --pod=minifluxapp \\ --volume=miniflux-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=<miniflux-db-admin> \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<miniflux-db-password> \\ --health-start-period=30s \\ --health-interval=10s \\ --health-cmd=\"CMD-SHELL pg_isready -U miniflux\" docker.io/library/postgres:latest Now, the miniflux container itself: $ podman run --name=miniflux -d --restart=always --pod=minifluxapp \\ -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://<db-user>:<db-pass>@localhost/miniflux?sslmode=disable \\ -e RUN_MIGRATIONS=1 \\ -e CREATE_ADMIN=1 \\ -e ADMIN_USERNAME=<admin-user> \\ -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin-pass> \\ --health-cmd=\"CMD-SHELL /usr/bin/miniflux -healthcheck auto\" ghcr.io/miniflux/miniflux:latest If all goes well, your containers should come up inside the pod, and the application is accessible via: http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost. From here, you could either generate a kubernetes pod definition4 to make it more reusable or systemd unit5 files to go together with your system administration. pod definition $ podman generate kube minifluxapp >> minifluxapp.yaml systemd units $ podman generate systemd \\ --container-prefix minifluxapp \\ --pod-prefix minifluxpod \\ --name minifluxapp https://docs.docker.com/compose/ ↩︎ https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/ ↩︎ https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ ↩︎ https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-kube-generate.1.html ↩︎ https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-generate-systemd.1.html ↩︎ Maverick Kaung IT Security Enthusiast Ye Myat “Maverick” Kaung is a highly motivated individual with a passion for security and open source software.
